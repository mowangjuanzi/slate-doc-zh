ID: 863357f99486f13541cb6ca7addd8a6221c03699\n\nSlate 是完全可定制的框架，用于构建富文本编辑器。\nSlate 可以构建丰富直观的编辑器，像 Medium、Dropbox Paper、Google Docs —— 这些正成为网络应用程序的中流砥柱 —— 不会让代码库陷入复杂。\n因为它的所有逻辑都是用一系列插件实现的，所以无论是否是“核心”都不会受到限制。你可以想象它是基于 React contenteditable 的可拔插实现。它的灵感来自于 Draft.js、Prosemirror、Quill 等库.\n\n🤖 Slate 目前处于测试阶段。核心 API 现在可以使用，但你也可以为高级用例 PR 修复。一些 API 没有“最终确定”且会随着时间的推移找到更好的方案后进行（破坏性）更新。\n\n为什么？\n为什么创建 Slate？ 嗯。。。（注意：本节有作者的一些意见！）\n在创建 Slate 之前，我尝试了很多富文本类库 —— Draft.js、Prosemirror、Quill等。我发现简单的示例运行起来很容易，一旦你尝试构建像 Medium、Dropbox Paper、Google Docs，你就会遇到更深层次的问题。。。\n\n编辑器的“模式”是硬编码的，难以修改。像是粗体斜体是开箱即用的，但是评论，嵌入，甚至更多特定领域需要的呢？\n以编程的方式转换文档非常复杂。作为用户编写可能会奏效，但是对构建高级行为至关重要的程序化更改是不必要的复杂。\n似乎是后来才想到序列化为 HTML、Markdown等。像是将文档转换为 HTML 或者 Markdown 这种简单的事情都需要编写大量的模板代码，这似乎是非常常见的用例。\n重新做视图层似乎效率低下且受到限制。大部分编辑器都使用了自己的视图，而不是使用像 React 这样现有的技术，所以你必须学习一个新的有“问题”的全新系统。\n没有预先设计协作编辑。通常编辑器的内部数据表示无法用于实时、协作编辑用例，除非是重写编辑器。\n存储库巨大，并非小而可复用。许多编辑器的代码库通常没有公开可用于开发人员复用的内部工具，导致不得不重新发明轮子。\n不能构建复杂嵌套文档。许多编辑器都是围绕“内部层次不多的”文档进行设计，使得表格、嵌入、字幕等内容难以实现，甚至不可能实现。\n\n当然并不是所有的编辑器都会有这些问题，但是你尝试使用其它编辑器，你可能会碰到类似的问题。为了绕过它们的 API 限制且实现你追求的用户体验，你必须借助非常 hack 的方式。有些经验是完全不可能实现的。\n如果听起来很熟悉，你可能会喜欢 Slate。\n这让我想到了如何 Slate 如何解决这些问题。。。\n原则\nSlate 尝试解决“为什么？”提出的问题。有几个原则：\n\n插件是一等公民。Slate 最重要的部分是插件是一等公民。这意味着你完全可以自定义编辑体验，构建像 Medium 或 Dropbox 一样复杂的编辑器，而无需猜测类库的呈现。\n无模式核心。Slate 的核心逻辑对要编写的数据模式几乎没有假设，这意味着当你需要编写复杂用例时，不会被任何库中的任何假设阻碍。\n嵌套文档模型。Slate 使用的文档模型是嵌套递归树，就像 DOM 一样。这意味着可以为高级用例创建复杂组件，如表格或者嵌套引用。但是也可以通过单个层级来保持简单。\n与 DOM 平等。Slate 的数据模型基于 DOM —— 文档是嵌套树，他用于选择和范围且公开所有标准事件处理程序。这意味表格或嵌套引用之类的高级行为是可能的。在 DOM 中执行的任何操作，几乎都可以在 Slate 中执行。\n命令直观。Slate 文档使用“命令”编辑，它被设计为高级且非常直观的读写，因此自定义功能必须尽可能的直观。这极大的提高了你推断代码的能力。\n协作式数据模型。Slate 使用的数据模型 —— 特别是如何将操作应用于文档 —— 设计为允许在顶层进行协作编辑，所以当决定让编辑器进行协作时无需重新考虑任何内容。\n清晰“核心”界限。借助插件优先架构和无模式核心，“核心”和“自定义”之间的界限变得更加清晰，这意味着核心体验不会在边缘情况下陷入困境。\n\nDemo\n查看所有示例的 在线 demo！\n示例\n要了解如何使用 Slate，请查看这些示例：\n\n纯文本 —— 展示最基本的情况：美化过的 。\n富文本 —— 展示你期望从基础编辑器中获得的行为。\nMarkdown 预览 — 展示如何为类 Markdown 结构体添加快捷键行处理程序。\n内联 —— 展示如何使用关联数据在内联节点文本换行。\n图片 —— 展示如何使用 void（无文本）节点添加图片。\n悬停工具栏 —— 展示如何实现上下文悬停菜单。\n表格 —— 展示如何嵌套块以渲染更多高级组件。\n粘贴 HTML —— 展示如何使用 HTML 序列化程序处理粘贴的 HTML。\n提及 —— 展示如何使用行内 void 节点实现简单的 @ 提及。\n\n每个示例都包含代码实现的 View Source 链接。我们还有其它示例。\n如果你对展示的常见示例有想法，请 PR！\n文档\n如果你是第一次使用 Slate，请查看入门演示和概念去熟悉 Slate 的架构和思维模型。\n\n演示\n概念\n常见问题\n资源\n\n如果还不够，你可以随时阅读源码，它包含了大量注释。\n也有将文档翻译成其他语言：\n\n中文【译者注：厚脸皮贴上本项目，修复请向此项目 PR】\n\n如果你正在维护翻译，请随时在此提交 PR！\n贡献！\n超级欢迎所有贡献！请查看贡献说明获取更多信息！\nSlate 是 MIT

useState 钩子而不是 setter：\nconst App = () => {\n  // 创建一个不会随着渲染而改变的 Slate 编辑器对象。\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n  return null\n}\n\n当然我们没有渲染任何东西，所以你不会看到任何改变。\n\n如果使用 TypeScript，还需要使用 ReactEditor 扩展 Editor 并根据 TypeScript 的文档添加注解。下面的示例还包括此示例剩余部分所需要的自定义类型。\n\n// 仅 TypeScript 用户添加此代码\nimport { BaseEditor, Descendant } from 'slate'\nimport { ReactEditor } from 'slate-react'\n\ntype CustomElement = { type: 'paragraph'; children: CustomText[] }\ntype CustomText = { text: string }\n\ndeclare module 'slate' {\n  interface CustomTypes {\n    Editor: BaseEditor & ReactEditor\n    Element: CustomElement\n    Text: CustomText\n  }\n}\n\n接下来渲染  内容提供者。\n提供者组件会保持对 Slate 编辑器、插件、值、选择以及发生任何更改的追踪。它必须在  组件上渲染。但是它也可以使用 useSlate 钩子将编辑器状态提供给工具栏、菜单等其它组件。\nconst initialValue = []\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n  // 渲染 Slate 上下文。\n  return \n}\n\n你可以将  组件为下面的每个组件提供上下文。\n\nSlate 提供者的 “value” prop 仅用作 editor.children 的初始状态。如果你的代码依赖替换 editor.children 你应该直接替换它，而不是依赖 “value” prop 去执行此操作。有关更深入的讨论请参阅 Slate PR 4540。\n\n这与  或  之类的心智模型略有不同，因为富文本文档更加复杂。你通常希望在可编辑内容旁边包含工具栏，实时预览或者其它复杂组件。\n通过共享上下文，其他组件可以执行命令，查询编辑器状态等。\n好，下一步是渲染  组件：\nconst initialValue = []\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n  return (\n    // 在上下文中添加可编辑组件。\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\n 组件的作用类似于 contenteditable。在任何地方渲染都会为最近的编辑器上下文渲染一个可编辑的富文本文档。\n只剩一步。到目前为止我们一直使用空的 [] 数组作为编辑器的初始值，所以没有内容。通过定义初始化值可以解决这个问题。\n值仅是普通的 JSON。这是包含一些文本的单个段落块：\n// 添加初始化值。\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\n明白了吧！\n这是 Slate 最基本的例子。如果将其渲染到页面上，将会看到带有文本 A line of text in a

&，会发现它突然变成了 and！\n这提示了使用 Slate 事件处理程序可以做什么的意义。每个都将调用 event 对象，你可以使用 editor

9892cf0ffbd741cc2880d1f0bd0d7c1b36145bbd\n\n在之前的示例中，在之前的段落中，但是并未真正告诉过 Slate 任何关于段落块类型的信息。只是让其使用内部默认渲染器，一个普通的老式 。\n但是能做的不仅仅是这些。Slate 允许定义任何自定义块类型，像引用、代码块、列表项等等。\n下面会介绍如何做。先从之前的应用开始吧：\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()),

“代码块” 到编辑器中。\n有个问题，就是代码块不能只使用普通的段落去渲染，还需要以不同的方式渲染。为了实现这一点，需要为 code 元素节点定义个“渲染器”。\n元素渲染器只是简单的 React 组件，如下所示：\n// 为代码块定义 React 组件渲染器。\nconst CodeElement = props => {\n  return (\n    \n      {props.children}\n    \n  )\n}\n\n是不是很容易。\n看到 props.attributes 引用了吗？Slate 传递应该在块的最上层元素上渲染的属性，所以不必自己构建它们。必须将属性组合到组件中。\n看到 props.children 引用了吧? Slate 会自动渲染块下面的所有子元素，然后像是其它 React 组件一样通过 props.children 传递。这样就不必费心渲染正确的文本节点或者类似的东西。必须将组件中的子元素作为最低叶子进行渲染。\n这是 “default” 元素组件：\nconst DefaultElement = props => {\n  return {props.children}\n}\n\n现在，添加渲染器到 Editor：\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  // 基于传递给 `props` 的元素定义渲染函数。\n  // 在这里使用 `useCallback` 记住函数以供后续渲染。\n  const renderElement = useCallback(props => {\n    switch (props.element.type) {\n      case 'code':\n        return \n      default:\n        return \n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    \n       {\n          if (event.key === '&') {\n            event.preventDefault()\n            editor.insertText('and')\n          }\n        }}\n      />\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst CodeElement = props => {\n  return (\n    \n      {props.children}\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst DefaultElement = props => {\n  return {props.children}\n}\n\n好，但现在需要一种方式让用户真正的将块转化为代码块。所以改变 onKeyDown 函数，添加 Ctrl + ` 快捷键来做这件事：\n// 从 Slate 导入 `Editor` 和 `Transforms` 助手。\nimport { Editor, Transforms } from 'slate'\n\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  const renderElement = useCallback(props => {\n    switch (props.element.type) {\n      case 'code':\n        return \n      default:\n        return \n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    \n       {\n          if (event.key === '`' && event.ctrlKey) {\n            // 默认防止插入 “`”。\n            event.preventDefault()\n            // 否则，将当前已选块类型设置为 “code”。\n            Transforms.setNodes(\n              editor,\n              { type: 'code' },\n              { match: n => Editor.isBlock(editor, n) }\n            )\n          }\n        }}\n      />\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst CodeElement = props => {\n  return (\n    \n      {props.children}\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst DefaultElement = props => {\n  return {props.children}\n}\n\n现在，如果按下 Ctrl + `，现在光标所在的块会变成代码块！神奇吧！\n但是忘记了一件事。就是当再次点击 Ctrl + ` 时，应该将代码块改回段落。为此，需要添加逻辑来根据当前选择的块是否是代码块来更改设置的类型：\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  const renderElement = useCallback(props => {\n    switch (props.element.type) {\n      case 'code':\n        return \n      default:\n        return \n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    \n       {\n          if (event.key === '`' && event.ctrlKey) {\n            event.preventDefault()\n            // 确认当前已选的块是代码块。\n            const [match] = Editor.nodes(editor, {\n              match: n => n.type === 'code',\n            })\n            // 根据时候已经匹配切换块类型。\n            Transforms.setNodes(\n              editor,\n              { type: match ?

But one of the most powerful things about Slate is that it lets you model your specific rich text \"domain\" however you'd like, and write less one-off code.\nIn the previous guides we've written some useful code to handle formatting code blocks and bold marks. And we've hooked up the onKeyDown handler to invoke that code. But we've always done it using the built-in Editor helpers directly, instead of using \"commands\".\nSlate lets you augment the built-in editor object to handle your own custom rich text commands. And you can even use pre-packaged \"plugins\" which add a given set of functionality.\nLet's see how this works.\nWe'll start with our app from earlier:\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  const renderElement = useCallback(props => {\n    switch (props.element.type) {\n      case 'code':\n        return \n      default:\n        return \n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  const renderLeaf = useCallback(props => {\n    return \n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    \n       {\n          if (!event.ctrlKey) {\n            return\n          }\n\n          switch (event.key) {\n            case '`': {\n              event.preventDefault()\n              const [match] = Editor.nodes(editor, {\n                match: n => n.type === 'code',\n              })\n              Transforms.setNodes(\n                editor,\n                { type: match ? null : 'code' },\n                { match: n => Editor.isBlock(editor, n) }\n              )\n              break\n            }\n\n            case 'b': {\n              event.preventDefault()\n              Transforms.setNodes(\n                editor,\n                { bold: true },\n                { match: n => Text.isText(n), split: true }\n              )\n              break\n            }\n          }\n        }}\n      />\n    \n  )\n}\n\nIt has the concept of \"code blocks\" and \"bold formatting\". But these things are all defined in one-off cases inside the onKeyDown handler. If you wanted to reuse that logic elsewhere you'd need to extract it.\nWe can instead implement these domain-specific concepts by creating custom helper functions:\n// Define our own custom set of helpers.\nconst CustomEditor = {\n  isBoldMarkActive(editor) {\n    const [match] = Editor.nodes(editor, {\n      match: n => n.bold === true,\n      universal: true,\n    })\n\n    return !!match\n  },\n\n  isCodeBlockActive(editor) {\n    const [match] = Editor.nodes(editor, {\n      match: n => n.type === 'code',\n    })\n\n    return !!match\n  },\n\n  toggleBoldMark(editor) {\n    const isActive = CustomEditor.isBoldMarkActive(editor)\n    Transforms.setNodes(\n      editor,\n      { bold: isActive ? null : true },\n      { match: n => Text.isText(n), split: true }\n    )\n  },\n\n  toggleCodeBlock(editor) {\n    const isActive = CustomEditor.isCodeBlockActive(editor)\n    Transforms.setNodes(\n      editor,\n      { type: isActive ? null : 'code' },\n      { match: n => Editor.isBlock(editor, n) }\n    )\n  },\n}\n\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  const renderElement = useCallback(props => {\n    switch (props.element.type) {\n      case 'code':\n        return \n      default:\n        return \n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  const renderLeaf = useCallback(props => {\n    return \n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    \n       {\n          if (!event.ctrlKey) {\n            return\n          }\n\n          // Replace the `onKeyDown` logic with our new commands.\n          switch (event.key) {\n            case '`': {\n              event.preventDefault()\n              CustomEditor.toggleCodeBlock(editor)\n              break\n            }\n\n            case 'b': {\n              event.preventDefault()\n              CustomEditor.toggleBoldMark(editor)\n              break\n            }\n          }\n        }}\n      />\n    \n  )\n}\n\nNow our commands are clearly defined and you can invoke them from anywhere we have access to our editor object. For example, from hypothetical toolbar buttons:\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  const renderElement = useCallback(props => {\n    switch (props.element.type) {\n      case 'code':\n        return \n      default:\n        return \n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  const renderLeaf = useCallback(props => {\n    return \n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    // Add a toolbar with buttons that call the same methods.\n    \n      \n         {\n            event.preventDefault()\n            CustomEditor.toggleBoldMark(editor)\n          }}\n        >\n          Bold\n        \n         {\n            event.preventDefault()\n            CustomEditor.toggleCodeBlock(editor)\n          }}\n        >\n          Code Block\n        \n      \n       {\n          if (!event.ctrlKey) {\n            return\n          }\n\n          switch (event.key) {\n            case '`': {\n              event.preventDefault()\n              CustomEditor.toggleCodeBlock(editor)\n              break\n            }\n\n            case 'b': {\n              event.preventDefault()\n              CustomEditor.toggleBoldMark(editor)\n              break\n            }\n          }\n        }}\n      />\n    \n  )\n}\n\nThat's the benefit of extracting the logic.\nAnd there you have it! We just added a ton of functionality to the editor with very little work. And we can keep all of our command logic tested and isolated in a single place, making the code easier to maintain.\n"},"walkthroughs/06-saving-to-a-database.html":{"url":"walkthroughs/06-saving-to-a-database.html","title":"Saving to a Database","keywords":"","body":"Saving to a Database\nNow that you've learned the basics of how to add functionality to the Slate editor, you might be wondering how you'd go about saving the content you've been editing, such that you can come back to your app later and have it load.\nIn this guide, we'll show you how to add logic to save your Slate content to a database for storage and retrieval later.\nLet's start with a basic editor:\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nThat will render a basic Slate editor on your page, and when you type things will change. But if you refresh the page, everything will be reverted back to its original value—nothing saves!\nWhat we need to do is save the changes you make somewhere. For this example, we'll just be using Local Storage, but it will give you an idea for where you'd need to add your own database hooks.\nSo, in our onChange handler, we need to save the value if anything besides the selection was changed:\nconst initialValue = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  return (\n     {\n        const isAstChange = editor.operations.some(\n          op => 'set_selection' !== op.type\n        )\n        if (isAstChange) {\n          // Save the value to Local Storage.\n          const content = JSON.stringify(value)\n          localStorage.setItem('content', content)\n        }\n      }}\n    >\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nNow whenever you edit the page, if you look in Local Storage, you should see the content value changing.\nBut... if you refresh the page, everything is still reset. That's because we need to make sure the initial value is pulled from that same Local Storage location, like so:\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n  // Update the initial content to be pulled from Local Storage if it exists.\n  const initialValue = useMemo(\n    () =>\n      JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('content')) || [\n        {\n          type: 'paragraph',\n          children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n        },\n      ],\n    []\n  )\n\n  return (\n     {\n        const isAstChange = editor.operations.some(\n          op => 'set_selection' !== op.type\n        )\n        if (isAstChange) {\n          // Save the value to Local Storage.\n          const content = JSON.stringify(value)\n          localStorage.setItem('content', content)\n        }\n      }}\n    >\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nNow you should be able to save changes across refreshes!\nSuccess—you've got JSON in your database.\nBut what if you want something other than JSON? Well, you'd need to serialize your value differently. For example, if you want to save your content as plain text instead of JSON, we can write some logic to serialize and deserialize plain text values:\n// Import the `Node` helper interface from Slate.\nimport { Node } from 'slate'\n\n// Define a serializing function that takes a value and returns a string.\nconst serialize = value => {\n  return (\n    value\n      // Return the string content of each paragraph in the value's children.\n      .map(n => Node.string(n))\n      // Join them all with line breaks denoting paragraphs.\n      .join('\\n')\n  )\n}\n\n// Define a deserializing function that takes a string and returns a value.\nconst deserialize = string => {\n  // Return a value array of children derived by splitting the string.\n  return string.split('\\n').map(line => {\n    return {\n      children: [{ text: line }],\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n  // Use our deserializing function to read the data from Local Storage.\n  const initialValue = useMemo(\n    deserialize(localStorage.getItem('content')) || '',\n    []\n  )\n\n  return (\n     {\n        const isAstChange = editor.operations.some(\n          op => 'set_selection' !== op.type\n        )\n        if (isAstChange) {\n          // Serialize the value and save the string value to Local Storage.\n          localStorage.setItem('content', serialize(value))\n        }\n      }}\n    >\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nThat works! Now you're working with plain text.\nYou can emulate this strategy for any format you like. You can serialize to HTML, to Markdown, or even to your own custom JSON format that is tailored to your use case.\n\n🤖 Note that even though you can serialize your content however you like, there are tradeoffs. The serialization process has a cost itself, and certain formats may be harder to work with than others. In general we recommend writing your own format only if your use case has a specific need for it. Otherwise, you're often better leaving the data in the format Slate uses.\n\nIf you want to update the editor's content in response to events from outside of slate, you need to change the children property directly. The simplest way is to replace the value of editor.children editor.children = newValue and trigger a re-rendering (e.g. by calling editor.onChange() in the example above). Alternatively, you can use slate's internal operations to transform the value, for example:\n  /**\n  * resetNodes resets the value of the editor.\n  * It should be noted that passing the `at` parameter may cause a \"Cannot resolve a DOM point from Slate point\" error.\n  */\n  resetNodes(\n    editor: Editor,\n    options: {\n      nodes?: Node | Node[],\n      at?: Location\n    } = {}\n  ): void {\n    const children = [...editor.children]\n\n    children.forEach((node) => editor.apply({ type: 'remove_node', path: [0], node }))\n\n    if (options.nodes) {\n      const nodes = Node.isNode(options.nodes) ? [options.nodes] : options.nodes\n\n      nodes.forEach((node, i) => editor.apply({ type: 'insert_node', path: [i], node: node }))\n    }\n\n    const point = options.at && Point.isPoint(options.at)\n      ? options.at\n      : Editor.end(editor, [])\n\n    if (point) {\n      Transforms.select(editor, point)\n    }\n  }\n\n"},"walkthroughs/xx-using-the-bundled-source.html":{"url":"walkthroughs/xx-using-the-bundled-source.html","title":"Using the Bundled Source","keywords":"","body":"Using the Bundled Source\nFor most folks, you'll want to install Slate via npm, in which case you can follow the regular Installing Slate guide.\nBut, if you'd rather install Slate by simply adding a  tag to your application, this guide will help you.

All it requires is that those JSON objects conform to certain interfaces. For example, a text node in Slate must obey the Text interface:\ninterface Text {\n  text: string\n}\n\nWhich means it must have a text property with a string of content.\nBut any other custom properties are also allowed, and completely up to you. This lets you tailor your data to your specific domain and use case, adding whatever formatting logic you'd like, without Slate getting in the way.\nThis interface-based approach separates Slate from most other rich text editors which require you to work with their hand-rolled \"model\" classes and makes it much easier to reason about. It also means that it avoids startup time penalties related to \"initializing\" the data model.\nCustom Properties\nTo take another example, the Element node interface in Slate is:\ninterface Element {\n  children: Node[]\n}\n\nThis is a very permissive interface. All it requires is that the children property gets defined containing the element's child nodes.\nBut you can extend elements (or any other interface) with your custom properties that are specific to your domain. For example, you might have \"paragraph\" and \"link\" elements:\nconst paragraph = {\n  type: 'paragraph',\n  children: [...],\n}\n\nconst link = {\n  type: 'link',\n  url: 'https://example.com',\n  children: [...]\n}\n\nThe type and url properties are your custom API. Slate sees that they exist, but doesn't use them. However, when Slate renders a link element, you'll receive an object with the custom properties attached so that you can render it as:\n{element.children}\n\nWhen getting started with Slate, it's important to understand all of the interfaces it defines. There are a handful of interfaces that are discussed in each of the guides.\nHelper Functions\nIn addition to the typing information, each interface in Slate also exposes a series of helper functions that make them easier to work with.\nFor example, when working with nodes:\nimport { Node } from 'slate'\n\n// Get the string content of an element node.\nconst string = Node.string(element)\n\n// Get the node at a specific path inside a root node.\nconst descendant = Node.get(value, path)\n\nOr, when working with ranges:\nimport { Range } from 'slate'\n\n// Get the start and end points of a range in order.\nconst [start, end] = Range.edges(range)\n\n// Check if a range is collapsed to a single point.\nif (Range.isCollapsed(range)) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nThere are many helper functions available for all common use cases when working with different interfaces. When getting started it helps to read through all of them so you can often simplify complex logic into just a handful of lines of code.\nCustom Helpers\nIn addition to the built-in helper functions, you might want to define your custom helper functions and expose them on your custom namespaces.\nFor example, if your editor supports images, you might want a helper that determines if an element is an image element:\nconst isImageElement = element => {\n  return element.type === 'image' && typeof element.url === 'string'\n}\n\nYou can define these as one-off functions easily. But you might also bundle them up into namespaces, just like the core interfaces do, and use them instead.\nFor example:\nimport { Element } from 'slate'\n\n// You can use `MyElement` everywhere to have access to your extensions.\nexport const MyElement = {\n  ...Element,\n  isImageElement,\n  isParagraphElement,\n  isQuoteElement,\n}\n\nThis makes it easy to reuse domain-specific logic alongside the built-in Slate helpers.\n"},"concepts/02-nodes.html":{"url":"concepts/02-nodes.html","title":"Nodes","keywords":"","body":"Nodes\nThe most important types are the Node objects:\n\nA root-level Editor node that contains the entire document's content.\nContainer Element nodes that have semantic meaning in your domain.\nAnd leaf-level Text nodes which contain the document's text.\n\nThese three interfaces are combined to form a tree—just like the DOM. For example, here's a simple plaintext value:\nconst editor = {\n  children: [\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph',\n      children: [\n        {\n          text: 'A line of text!',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n  // ...the editor has other properties too.\n}\n\nMirroring the DOM as much as possible is one of Slate's principles. People use the DOM to represent documents with rich text-like structures all the time. Mirroring the DOM helps make the library familiar for new users, and it lets us reuse battle-tested patterns without having to reinvent them ourselves.\n\n🤖 The following content on Mozilla's Developer Network may help you learn more about the corresponding DOM concepts:\n\nDocument\nBlock Elements\nInline elements\nText elements\n\n\nA Slate document is a nested and recursive structure. In a document, elements can have children nodes—all of which may have children nodes without limit. The nested and recursive structure enables you to model simple behaviors such as user mentions and hashtags or complex behaviors such as tables and figures with captions.\nEditor\nThe top-level node in a Slate document is the Editor itself. It encapsulates all of the rich text \"content\" of the document. Its interface is:\ninterface Editor {\n  children: Node[]\n  ...\n}\n\nWe'll cover its functionality later, but the important part as far as nodes are concerned is its children property which contains a tree of Node objects.\nElement\nElements make up the middle layers of a rich text document. They are the nodes that are custom to your domain. Their interface is:\ninterface Element {\n  children: Node[]\n}\n\nYou can define custom elements for any type of content you want. For example, you might have paragraphs and quotes in your data model which are differentiated by a type property:\nconst paragraph = {\n  type: 'paragraph',\n  children: [...],\n}\n\nconst quote = {\n  type: 'quote',\n  children: [...],\n}\n\nIt's important to note that you can use any custom properties you want. The type property in that example isn't something Slate knows or cares about. If you were defining your own \"link\" nodes, you might have a url property:\nconst link = {\n  type: 'link',\n  url: 'https://example.com',\n  children: [...],\n}\n\nOr maybe you want to give all of your nodes an ID property:\nconst paragraph = {\n  id: 1,\n  type: 'paragraph',\n  children: [...],\n}\n\nAll that matters is that elements always have a children property.\nBlocks vs. Inlines\nDepending on your use case, you might want to define another behavior for Element nodes which determines their editing \"flow\".\nAll elements default to being \"block\" elements. They each appear separated by vertical space, and they never run into each other.\nBut in certain cases, like for links, you might want to make them \"inline\" flowing elements instead. That way they live at the same level as text nodes, and flow.\n\n🤖 This is a concept borrowed from the DOM's behavior, see Block Elements and Inline Elements.\n\nYou can define which nodes are treated as inline nodes by overriding the editor.isInline function. (By default it always returns false.) Note that inline nodes cannot be the first or last child of a parent block, nor can they be next to another inline node in the children array. Slate will automatically space these with { text: '' } children by default with normalizeNode.\nElements can either contain block elements or inline elements intermingled with text nodes as children. But elements cannot contain some children that are blocks and some that are inlined.\nVoids\nSimilar to blocks and inlines, there is another element-specific behavior you can define depending on your use case: their \"void\"-ness.\nElements default to being non-void, meaning that their children are fully editable as text. But in some cases, like for images, you want to ensure that Slate doesn't treat their content as editable text, but instead as a black box.\n\n🤖 This is a concept borrowed from the HTML spec, see Void Elements.\n\nYou can define which elements are treated as void by overriding the editor.isVoid function. (By default it always returns false.) See Rendering Void Elements for implementation details.\nText\nText nodes are the lowest-level nodes in the tree, containing the text content of the document, along with any formatting. Their interface is:\ninterface Text {\n  text: string\n}\n\nFor example, a string of bold text:\nconst text = {\n  text: 'A string of bold text',\n  bold: true,\n}\n\nText nodes too can contain any custom properties you want, and that's how you implement custom formatting like bold, italic, code, etc.\nThese custom properties are sometimes called marks.\n"},"concepts/03-locations.html":{"url":"concepts/03-locations.html","title":"Locations","keywords":"","body":"Locations\nLocations are how you refer to specific places in the document when inserting, deleting, or doing anything else with a Slate editor. There are a few different kinds of location interfaces, each for different use cases.\nPath\nPaths are the lowest-level way to refer to a location. Each path is a simple array of numbers that refers to a node in the document tree by its indexes in each of its ancestor nodes down the tree:\ntype Path = number[]\n\nFor example, in this document:\nconst editor = {\n  children: [\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph',\n      children: [\n        {\n          text: 'A line of text!',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\nThe leaf text node would have a path of: [0, 0].\nThe Editor itself has a path of []. For example, to select the whole contents of the editor, call\nTransforms.select(editor, [])\nPoint\nPoints are slightly more specific than paths, and contain an offset into a specific text node. Their interface is:\ninterface Point {\n  path: Path\n  offset: number\n}\n\nFor example, with that same document, if you wanted to refer to the very first place you could put your cursor it would be:\nconst start = {\n  path: [0, 0],\n  offset: 0,\n}\n\nOr, if you wanted to refer to the end of the sentence:\nconst end = {\n  path: [0, 0],\n  offset: 15,\n}\n\nIt can be helpful to think of points as being \"cursors\" (or \"carets\") of a selection.\n\n🤖 Points always refer to text nodes! Since they are the only ones with strings that can have cursors.\n\nRange\nRanges are a way to refer not just to a single point in the document, but to a wider span of content between two points. (An example of a range is when you make a selection.) Their interface is:\ninterface Range {\n  anchor: Point\n  focus: Point\n}\n\n\n🤖 The terms \"anchor\" and \"focus\" are borrowed from the DOM, see Anchor and Focus.\n\nAn anchor and focus are established by a user interaction. The anchor point isn't always before the focus point in the document. Just like in the DOM, the ordering of an anchor and selection point depend on whether the range is backwards or forwards.\nHere's how Mozilla Developer Network explains it:\n\nA user may make a selection from left to right (in document order) or right to left (reverse of document order). The anchor is where the user began the selection and the focus is where the user ends the selection. If you make a selection with a desktop mouse, the anchor is placed where you pressed the mouse button and the focus is placed where you released the mouse button. Anchor and focus should not be confused with the start and end positions of a selection, since anchor can be placed before the focus or vice versa, depending on the direction you made your selection. — Selection, MDN\n\nOne important distinction is that the anchor and focus points of ranges always reference the leaf-level text nodes in a document and never reference elements. This behavior is different than the DOM, but it simplifies working with ranges as there are fewer edge cases for you to handle.\n\n🤖 For more info, check out the Range API reference.\n\nSelection\nRanges are used in many places in Slate's API when you need to refer to a span of content between two points. One of the most common though is the user's current \"selection\".\nThe selection is a special range that is a property of the top-level Editor. For example, say someone has the whole sentence currently selected:\nconst editor = {\n  selection: {\n    anchor: { path: [0, 0], offset: 0 },\n    focus: { path: [0, 0], offset: 15 },\n  },\n  children: [\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph',\n      children: [\n        {\n          text: 'A line of text!',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\n\n🤖 The selection concept is also borrowed from the DOM, see Selection, MDN, although in a greatly-simplified form because Slate doesn't allow for multiple ranges inside a single selection, which makes things a lot easier to work with.\n\nThere isn't a special Selection interface. It's just an object that happens to respect the more general-purpose Range interface instead.\n"},"concepts/04-transforms.html":{"url":"concepts/04-transforms.html","title":"Transforms","keywords":"","body":"Transforms\nSlate's data structure is immutable, so you can't modify or delete nodes directly. Instead, Slate comes with a collection of \"transform\" functions that let you change your editor's value.\nSlate's transform functions are designed to be very flexible, to make it possible to represent all kinds of changes you might need to make to your editor. However, that flexibility can be hard to understand at first.\nTypically, you'll apply a single operation to zero or more Nodes. For example, here's how you flatten the syntax tree,\nby applying unwrapNodes to every parent of block Elements:\nTransforms.unwrapNodes(editor, {\n  at: [], // Path of Editor\n  match: node =>\n    !Editor.isEditor(node) &&\n    node.children?.every(child => Editor.isBlock(editor, child)),\n  mode: 'all', // also the Editor's children\n})\n\nNon-standard operations (or debugging/tracing which Nodes will be affected by a set of NodeOptions) may require using\nEditor.nodes to create a JavaScript Iterator of NodeEntries and a for..of loop to act.\nFor example, to replace all image elements with their alt text:\nconst imageElmnts = Editor.nodes(editor, {\n  at: [], // Path of Editor\n  match: (node, path) => 'image' === node.type,\n  // mode defaults to \"all\", so this also searches the Editor's children\n})\nfor (const nodeEntry of imageElmnts) {\n  const altText =\n    nodeEntry[0].alt ||\n    nodeEntry[0].title ||\n    /\\/([^/]+)$/.exec(nodeEntry[0].url)?.[1] ||\n    '☹︎'\n  Transforms.select(editor, nodeEntry[1])\n  Editor.insertFragment(editor, [{ text: altText }])\n}\n\n\n🤖 Check out the Transforms reference for a full list of Slate's transforms.\n\nSelection Transforms\nSelection-related transforms are some of the simpler ones. For example, here's how you set the selection to a new range:\nTransforms.select(editor, {\n  anchor: { path: [0, 0], offset: 0 },\n  focus: { path: [1, 0], offset: 2 },\n})\n\nBut they can be more complex too.\nFor example, it's common to need to move a cursor forwards or backwards by varying distances—by character, by word, by line. Here's how you'd move the cursor backwards by three words:\nTransforms.move(editor, {\n  distance: 3,\n  unit: 'word',\n  reverse: true,\n})\n\n\n🤖 For more info, check out the Selection Transforms API Reference\n\nText Transforms\nText transforms act on the text content of the editor. For example, here's how you'd insert a string of text as a specific point:\nTransforms.insertText(editor, 'some words', {\n  at: { path: [0, 0], offset: 3 },\n})\n\nOr you could delete all of the content in an entire range from the editor:\nTransforms.delete(editor, {\n  at: {\n    anchor: { path: [0, 0], offset: 0 },\n    focus: { path: [1, 0], offset: 2 },\n  },\n})\n\n\n🤖 For more info, check out the Text Transforms API Reference\n\nNode Transforms\nNode transforms act on the individual element and text nodes that make up the editor's value. For example you could insert a new text node at a specific path:\nTransforms.insertNodes(\n  editor,\n  {\n    text: 'A new string of text.',\n  },\n  {\n    at: [0, 1],\n  }\n)\n\nOr you could move nodes from one path to another:\nTransforms.moveNodes(editor, {\n  at: [0, 0],\n  to: [0, 1],\n})\n\n\n🤖 For more info, check out the Node Transforms API Reference\n\nThe at Option\nMany transforms act on a specific location in the document. By default, they will use the user's current selection. But this can be overridden with the at option.\nFor example when inserting text, this would insert the string at the user's current cursor:\nTransforms.insertText(editor, 'some words')\n\nWhereas this would insert it at a specific point:\nTransforms.insertText(editor, 'some words', {\n  at: { path: [0, 0], offset: 3 },\n})\n\nThe at option is very versatile, and can be used to implement more complex transforms very easily. Since it is a Location it can always be either a Path, Point, or Range. And each of those types of locations will result in slightly different transformations.\nFor example, in the case of inserting text, if you specify a Range location, the range will first be deleted, collapsing to a single point where your text is then inserted.\nSo to replace a range of text with a new string you can do:\nTransforms.insertText(editor, 'some words', {\n  at: {\n    anchor: { path: [0, 0], offset: 0 },\n    focus: { path: [0, 0], offset: 3 },\n  },\n})\n\nOr, if you specify a Path location, it will expand to a range that covers the entire node at that path. Then, using the range-based behavior it will delete all of the content of the node, and replace it with your text.\nSo to replace the text of an entire node with a new string you can do:\nTransforms.insertText(editor, 'some words', {\n  at: [0, 0],\n})\n\nThese location-based behaviors work for all the transforms that take an at option. It can be hard to wrap your head around at first, but it makes the API very powerful and capable of expressing many subtly different transforms.\nThe match Option\nMany of the node-based transforms take a match function option, which restricts the transform to only apply to nodes for which the function returns true. When combined with at, match can also be very powerful.\nFor example, consider a basic transform that moves a node from one path to another:\nTransforms.moveNodes(editor, {\n  at: [2],\n  to: [5],\n})\n\nAlthough it looks like it simply takes a path and moves it to another place. Under the hood two things are happening…\nFirst, the at option is expanded to be a range representing all of the content inside the node at [2]. Which might look something like:\nat: {\n  anchor: { path: [2, 0], offset: 0 },\n  focus: { path: [2, 2], offset: 19 }\n}\n\nSecond, the match option is defaulted to a function that only matches the specific path, in this case [2]:\nmatch: (node, path) => Path.equals(path, [2])\n\nThen Slate iterates over the range and moves any nodes that pass the matcher function to the new location. In this case, since match is defaulted to only match the exact [2] path, that node is moved.\nBut what if you wanted to move the children of the node at [2] instead?\nYou might consider looping over the node's children and moving them one at a time, but this gets very complex to manage because as you move the nodes the paths you're referring to become outdated.\nInstead, you can take advantage of the at and match options to match all of the children:\nTransforms.moveNodes(editor, {\n  // This will again be expanded to a range of the entire node at `[2]`.\n  at: [2],\n  // Matches nodes with a longer path, which are the children.\n  match: (node, path) => path.length === 2,\n  to: [5],\n})\n\nHere we're using the same at path (which is expanded to a range), but instead of letting it match just that path by default, we're supplying our own match function which happens to match only the children of the node.\nUsing match can make representing complex logic a lot simpler.\nFor example, consider wanting to add a bold mark to any text nodes that aren't already italic:\nTransform.setNodes(\n  editor,\n  { bold: true },\n  {\n    // This path references the editor, and is expanded to a range that\n    // will encompass all the content of the editor.\n    at: [],\n    // This only matches text nodes that are not already italic.\n    match: (node, path) => Text.isText(node) && node.italic !== true,\n  }\n)\n\nWhen performing transforms, if you're ever looping over nodes and transforming them one at a time, consider seeing if match can solve your use case, and offload the complexity of managing loops to Slate instead.\nThe match function can examine the children of a node, in node.children, or use Node.parent to examine its parent.\nTransforms and Normalization\nSequences of Transforms may need to be wrapped in Editor.withoutNormalizing if the node tree should not be normalized between Transforms.\nSee Normalization - Implications for Other Code;\n"},"concepts/05-operations.html":{"url":"concepts/05-operations.html","title":"Operations","keywords":"","body":"Operations\nOperations are the granular, low-level actions that occur while invoking transforms. A single transform could result in many low-level operations being applied to the editor.\nSlate's core defines all of the possible operations that can occur on a richtext document. For example:\neditor.apply({\n  type: 'insert_text',\n  path: [0, 0],\n  offset: 15,\n  text: 'A new string of text to be inserted.',\n})\n\neditor.apply({\n  type: 'remove_node',\n  path: [0, 0],\n  node: {\n    text: 'A line of text!',\n  },\n})\n\neditor.apply({\n  type: 'set_selection',\n  properties: {\n    anchor: { path: [0, 0], offset: 0 },\n  },\n  newProperties: {\n    anchor: { path: [0, 0], offset: 15 },\n  },\n})\n\nUnder the covers Slate converts complex transforms into the low-level operations and applies them to the editor automatically. So you rarely have to think about operations unless you're implementing collaborative editing.\n\n🤖 Slate's editing behaviors being defined as operations is what makes things like collaborative editing possible, because each change is easily define-able, apply-able, compose-able and even undo-able!\n\n"},"concepts/06-commands.html":{"url":"concepts/06-commands.html","title":"Commands","keywords":"","body":"Commands\nWhile editing richtext content, your users will be doing things like inserting text, deleting text, splitting paragraphs, adding formatting, etc. Under the cover these edits are expressed using transforms and operations. But at a high level we talk about them as \"commands\".\nCommands are the high-level actions that represent a specific intent of the user. They are represented as helper functions on the Editor interface. A handful of helpers are included in core for common richtext behaviors, but you are encouraged to write your own that model your specific domain.\nFor example, here are some of the built-in commands:\nEditor.insertText(editor, 'A new string of text to be inserted.')\n\nEditor.deleteBackward(editor, { unit: 'word' })\n\nEditor.insertBreak(editor)\n\nBut you can (and will!) also define your own custom commands that model your domain. For example, you might want to define a formatQuote command, or an insertImage command, or a toggleBold command depending on what types of content you allow.\nCommands always describe an action to be taken as if the user was performing the action. For that reason, they never need to define a location to perform the command, because they always act on the user's current selection.\n\n🤖 The concept of commands is loosely based on the DOM's built-in execCommand APIs. However Slate defines its own simpler (and extendable!) version of the API, because the DOM's version is too opinionated and inconsistent.\n\nUnder the covers, Slate takes care of converting each command into a set of low-level \"operations\" that are applied to produce a new value. This is what makes collaborative editing implementations possible. But you don't have to worry about that, because it happens automatically.\nCustom Commands\nWhen defining custom commands, you can create your own namespace:\nconst MyEditor = {\n  ...Editor,\n\n  insertParagraph(editor) {\n    // ...\n  },\n}\n\nWhen writing your own commands, you'll often make use of the Transforms helpers that ship with Slate.\nTransforms\nTransforms are a specific set of helpers that allow you to perform a wide variety of specific changes to the document, for example:\n// Set a \"bold\" format on all of the text nodes in a range.\nTransforms.setNodes(\n  editor,\n  { bold: true },\n  {\n    at: range,\n    match: node => Text.isText(node),\n    split: true,\n  }\n)\n\n// Wrap the lowest block at a point in the document in a quote block.\nTransforms.wrapNodes(\n  editor,\n  { type: 'quote', children: [] },\n  {\n    at: point,\n    match: node => Editor.isBlock(editor, node),\n    mode: 'lowest',\n  }\n)\n\n// Insert new text to replace the text in a node at a specific path.\nTransforms.insertText(editor, 'A new string of text.', { at: path })\n\n// ...there are many more transforms!\n\nThe transform helpers are designed to be composed together. So you might use a handful of them for each command.\n"},"concepts/07-editor.html":{"url":"concepts/07-editor.html","title":"Editor","keywords":"","body":"Editor\nAll of the behaviors, content and state of a Slate editor is rolled up into a single, top-level Editor object.

(Since Slate batches operations up into ticks of the event loop.)\nThe marks property stores formatting to be applied when the editor inserts text. If marks is null, the formatting will be taken from the current selection.\nDon't set it directly; use Editor.addMark and Editor.removeMark.\nOverriding Behaviors\nIn previous guides we've already hinted at this, but you can override any of the behaviors of an editor by overriding its function properties.\nFor example, if you want to define link elements that are inline nodes:\nconst { isInline } = editor\n\neditor.isInline = element => {\n  return element.type === 'link' ? true : isInline(element)\n}\n\nOr maybe you want to override the insertText behavior to \"linkify\" URLs:\nconst { insertText } = editor\n\neditor.insertText = text => {\n  if (isUrl(text)) {\n    // ...\n    return\n  }\n\n  insertText(text)\n}\n\nOr you can even define custom \"normalizations\" that take place to ensure that links obey certain constraints:\nconst { normalizeNode } = editor\n\neditor.normalizeNode = entry => {\n  const [node, path] = entry\n\n  if (Element.isElement(node) && node.type === 'link') {\n    // ...\n    return\n  }\n\n  normalizeNode(entry)\n}\n\nWhenever you override behaviors, be sure to call the existing functions as a fallback mechanism for the default behavior. Unless you really do want to completely remove the default behaviors (which is rarely a good idea).\n\n🤖 For more info, check out the Editor Instance Methods to Override API Reference\n\nHelper Functions\nThe Editor interface, like all Slate interfaces, exposes helper functions that are useful when implementing certain behaviors. There are many, many editor-related helpers. For example:\n// Get the start point of a specific node at path.\nconst point = Editor.start(editor, [0, 0])\n\n// Get the fragment (a slice of the document) at a range.\nconst fragment = Editor.fragment(editor, range)\n\nThere are also many iterator-based helpers, for example:\n// Iterate over every node in a range.\nfor (const [node, path] of Editor.nodes(editor, { at: range })) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// Iterate over every point in every text node in the current selection.\nfor (const point of Editor.positions(editor)) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n\n🤖 For more info, check out the Editor Static Methods API Reference\n\n"},"concepts/08-plugins.html":{"url":"concepts/08-plugins.html","title":"Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Plugins\nYou've already seen how the behaviors of Slate editors can be overridden. These overrides can also be packaged up into \"plugins\" to be reused, tested and shared. This is one of the most powerful aspects of Slate's architecture.\nA plugin is simply a function that takes an Editor object and returns it after it has augmented it in some way.\nFor example, a plugin that marks image nodes as \"void\":\nconst withImages = editor => {\n  const { isVoid } = editor\n\n  editor.isVoid = element => {\n    return element.type === 'image' ? true : isVoid(element)\n  }\n\n  return editor\n}\n\nAnd then to use the plugin, simply:\nimport { createEditor } from 'slate'\n\nconst editor = withImages(createEditor())\n\nThis plugin composition model makes Slate extremely easy to extend!\nHelper Functions\nIn addition to the plugin functions, you might want to expose helper functions that are used alongside your plugins. For example:\nimport { Editor, Element } from 'slate'\n\nconst MyEditor = {\n  ...Editor,\n  insertImage(editor, url) {\n    const element = { type: 'image', url, children: [{ text: '' }] }\n    Transforms.insertNodes(editor, element)\n  },\n}\n\nconst MyElement = {\n  ...Element,\n  isImageElement(value) {\n    return Element.isElement(element) && element.type === 'image'\n  },\n}\n\nThen you can use MyEditor and MyElement everywhere and have access to all your helpers in one place.\n"},"concepts/09-rendering.html":{"url":"concepts/09-rendering.html","title":"Rendering","keywords":"","body":"Rendering\nOne of the best parts of Slate is that it's built with React, so it fits right into your existing application. It doesn't re-invent its own view layer that you have to learn. It tries to keep everything as React-y as possible.\nTo that end, Slate gives you control over the rendering behavior of your custom nodes and properties in your richtext domain.\nYou can define these behaviors by passing \"render props\" to the top-level  component.\nFor example if you wanted to render custom element components, you'd pass in the renderElement prop:\nimport { createEditor } from 'slate'\nimport { Slate, Editable, withReact } from 'slate-react'\n\nconst MyEditor = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n  const renderElement = useCallback(({ attributes, children, element }) => {\n    switch (element.type) {\n      case 'quote':\n        return {children}\n      case 'link':\n        return (\n          \n            {children}\n          \n        )\n      default:\n        return {children}\n    }\n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\n\n🤖 Be sure to mix in props.attributes and render props.children in your custom components! The attributes must be added to the top-level DOM element inside the component, as they are required for Slate's DOM helper functions to work. And the children are the actual text content of your document which Slate manages for you automatically.\n\nYou don't have to use simple HTML elements, you can use your own custom React components too:\nconst renderElement = useCallback(props => {\n  switch (props.element.type) {\n    case 'quote':\n      return \n    case 'link':\n      return \n    default:\n      return \n  }\n}, [])\n\nLeaves\nWhen text-level formatting is rendered, the characters are grouped into \"leaves\" of text that each contain the same formatting applied to them.\nTo customize the rendering of each leaf, you use a custom renderLeaf prop:\nconst renderLeaf = useCallback(({ attributes, children, leaf }) => {\n  return (\n    \n      {children}\n    \n  )\n}, [])\n\nNotice though how we've handled it slightly differently than renderElement. Since text formatting tends to be fairly simple, we've opted to ditch the switch statement and just toggle on/off a few styles instead. (But there's nothing preventing you from using custom components if you'd like!)\nOne disadvantage of text-level formatting is that you cannot guarantee that any given format is \"contiguous\"—meaning that it stays as a single leaf. This limitation with respect to leaves is similar to the DOM, where this is invalid:\ntext\n\nBecause the elements in the above example do not properly close themselves they are invalid. Instead, you would write the above HTML as follows:\ntext\n\nIf you happened to add another overlapping section of  to that text, you might have to rearrange the closing tags yet again. Rendering leaves in Slate is similar—you can't guarantee that even though a word has one type of formatting applied to it that that leaf will be contiguous, because it depends on how it overlaps with other formatting.\nOf course, this leaf stuff sounds pretty complex. But, you do not have to think about it much, as long as you use text-level formatting and element-level formatting for their intended purposes:\n\nText properties are for non-contiguous, character-level formatting.\nElement properties are for contiguous, semantic elements in the document.\n\nDecorations\nDecorations are another type of text-level formatting. They are similar to regular old custom properties, except each one applies to a Range of the document instead of being associated with a given text node.\nHowever, decorations are computed at render-time based on the content itself. This is helpful for dynamic formatting like syntax highlighting or search keywords, where changes to the content (or some external data) has the potential to change the formatting.\nDecorations are different from Marks in that they are not stored on editor state.\nToolbars, Menus, Overlays, and more!\nIn addition to controlling the rendering of nodes inside Slate, you can also retrieve the current editor context from inside other components using the useSlate hook.\nThat way other components can execute commands, query the editor state, or anything else.\nA common use case for this is rendering a toolbar with formatting buttons that are highlighted based on the current selection:\nconst MyEditor = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst Toolbar = () => {\n  const editor = useSlate()\n  return (\n    \n      B\n      I\n    \n  )\n}\n\nBecause the  uses the useSlate hook to retrieve the context, it will re-render whenever the editor changes, so that the active state of the buttons stays in sync.\n"},"concepts/10-serializing.html":{"url":"concepts/10-serializing.html","title":"Serializing","keywords":"","body":"Serializing\nSlate's data model has been built with serialization in mind. Specifically, its text nodes are defined in a way that makes them easier to read at a glance, but also easy to serialize to common formats like HTML and Markdown.\nAnd, because Slate uses plain JSON for its data, you can write serialization logic very easily.\nPlaintext\nFor example, taking the value of an editor and returning plaintext:\nimport { Node } from 'slate'\n\nconst serialize = nodes => {\n  return nodes.map(n => Node.string(n)).join('\\n')\n}\n\nHere we're taking the children nodes of an Editor as a nodes argument, and returning a plaintext representation where each top-level node is separated by a single \\n new line character.\nFor an input of:\nconst nodes = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'An opening paragraph...' }],\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'quote',\n    children: [{ text: 'A wise quote.' }],\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A closing paragraph!' }],\n  },\n]\n\nYou'd end up with:\nAn opening paragraph...\nA wise quote.\nA closing paragraph!\n\nNotice how the quote block isn't distinguishable in any way, that's because we're talking about plaintext. But you can serialize the data to anything you want—it's just JSON after all.\nHTML\nFor example, here's a similar serialize function for HTML:\nimport escapeHtml from 'escape-html'\nimport { Text } from 'slate'\n\nconst serialize = node => {\n  if (Text.isText(node)) {\n    let string = escapeHtml(node.text)\n    if (node.bold) {\n      string = `${string}`\n    }\n    return string\n  }\n\n  const children = node.children.map(n => serialize(n)).join('')\n\n  switch (node.type) {\n    case 'quote':\n      return `${children}`\n    case 'paragraph':\n      return `${children}`\n    case 'link':\n      return `${children}`\n    default:\n      return children\n  }\n}\n\nThis one is a bit more aware than the plaintext serializer above. It's actually recursive so that it can keep iterating deeper through a node's children until it gets to the leaf text nodes. And for each node it receives, it converts it to an HTML string.\nIt also takes a single node as input instead of an array, so if you passed in an editor like:\nconst editor = {\n  children: [\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph',\n      children: [\n        { text: 'An opening paragraph with a ' },\n        {\n          type: 'link',\n          url: 'https://example.com',\n          children: [{ text: 'link' }],\n        },\n        { text: ' in it.' },\n      ],\n    },\n    {\n      type: 'quote',\n      children: [{ text: 'A wise quote.' }],\n    },\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph',\n      children: [{ text: 'A closing paragraph!' }],\n    },\n  ],\n  // `Editor` objects also have other properties that are omitted here...\n}\n\nYou'd receive back (line breaks added for legibility):\nAn opening paragraph with a link in it.\nA wise quote.\nA closing paragraph!\n\nIt's really that easy!\nDeserializing\nAnother common use case in Slate is doing the reverse—deserializing. This is when you have some arbitrary input and want to convert it into a Slate-compatible JSON structure. For example, when someone pastes HTML into your editor and you want to ensure it gets parsed with the proper formatting for your editor.\nSlate has a built-in helper for this: the slate-hyperscript package.\nThe most common way to use slate-hyperscript is for writing JSX documents, for example when writing tests. You might use it like so:\n/** @jsx jsx */\nimport { jsx } from 'slate-hyperscript'\n\nconst input = (\n  \n    A line of text.\n  \n)\n\nAnd the JSX feature of your compiler (Babel, TypeScript, etc.) would turn that input variable into:\nconst input = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nThis is great for test cases, or places where you want to be able to write a lot of Slate objects in a very readable form.\nHowever! This doesn't help with deserialization.\nBut slate-hyperscript isn't only for JSX. It's just a way to build trees of Slate content. Which happens to be exactly what you want to do when you're deserializing something like HTML.\nFor example, here's a deserialize function for HTML:\nimport { jsx } from 'slate-hyperscript'\n\nconst deserialize = (el, markAttributes = {}) => {\n  if (el.nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE) {\n    return jsx('text', markAttributes, el.textContent)\n  } else if (el.nodeType !== Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  const nodeAttributes = { ...markAttributes }\n\n  // define attributes for text nodes\n  switch (el.nodeName) {\n    case 'strong':\n      nodeAttributes.bold = true\n  }\n\n  const children = Array.from(el.childNodes)\n    .map(node => deserialize(node, nodeAttributes))\n    .flat()\n\n  if (children.length === 0) {\n    children.push(jsx('text', nodeAttributes, ''))\n  }\n\n  switch (el.nodeName) {\n    case 'BODY':\n      return jsx('fragment', {}, children)\n    case 'BR':\n      return '\\n'\n    case 'BLOCKQUOTE':\n      return jsx('element', { type: 'quote' }, children)\n    case 'P':\n      return jsx('element', { type: 'paragraph' }, children)\n    case 'A':\n      return jsx(\n        'element',\n        { type: 'link', url: el.getAttribute('href') },\n        children\n      )\n    default:\n      return children\n  }\n}\n\nIt takes in an el HTML element object and returns a Slate fragment. So if you have an HTML string, you can parse and deserialize it like so:\nconst html = '...'\nconst document = new DOMParser().parseFromString(html, 'text/html')\ndeserialize(document.body)\n\nWith this input:\nAn opening paragraph with a link in it.\nA wise quote.\nA closing paragraph!\n\nYou'd end up with this output:\nconst fragment = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [\n      { text: 'An opening paragraph with a ' },\n      {\n        type: 'link',\n        url: 'https://example.com',\n        children: [{ text: 'link' }],\n      },\n      { text: ' in it.' },\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'quote',\n    children: [\n      {\n        type: 'paragraph',\n        children: [{ text: 'A wise quote.' }],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A closing paragraph!' }],\n  },\n]\n\nAnd just like the serializing function, you can extend it to fit your exact domain model's needs.\n"},"concepts/11-normalizing.html":{"url":"concepts/11-normalizing.html","title":"Normalizing","keywords":"","body":"Normalizing\nSlate editors can edit complex, nested data structures. And for the most part this is great. But in certain cases inconsistencies in the data structure can be introduced—most often when allowing a user to paste arbitrary richtext content.\n\"Normalizing\" is how you can ensure that your editor's content is always of a certain shape. It's similar to \"validating\", except instead of just determining whether the content is valid or invalid, its job is to fix the content to make it valid again.\nBuilt-in Constraints\nSlate editors come with a few built-in constraints out of the box. These constraints are there to make working with content much more predictable than standard contenteditable. All of the built-in logic in Slate depends on these constraints, so unfortunately you cannot omit them. They are...\n\nAll Element nodes must contain at least one Text descendant — even Void Elements. If an element node does not contain any children, an empty text node will be added as its only child. This constraint exists to ensure that the selection's anchor and focus points (which rely on referencing text nodes) can always be placed inside any node. With this, empty elements (or void elements) wouldn't be selectable.\nTwo adjacent texts with the same custom properties will be merged. If two adjacent text nodes have the same formatting, they're merged into a single text node with a combined text string of the two. This exists to prevent the text nodes from only ever expanding in count in the document, since both adding and removing formatting results in splitting text nodes.\nBlock nodes can only contain other blocks, or inline and text nodes. For example, a paragraph block cannot have another paragraph block element and a link inline element as children at the same time. The type of children allowed is determined by the first child, and any other non-conforming children are removed. This ensures that common richtext behaviors like \"splitting a block in two\" function consistently.\nInline nodes cannot be the first or last child of a parent block, nor can it be next to another inline node in the children array. If this is the case, an empty text node will be added to correct this to be in compliance with the constraint.\nThe top-level editor node can only contain block nodes. If any of the top-level children are inline or text nodes they will be removed. This ensures that there are always block nodes in the editor so that behaviors like \"splitting a block in two\" work as expected.\nNodes must be JSON-serializable. For example, avoid using undefined in your data model. This ensures that operations are also JSON-serializable, a property which is assumed by collaboration libraries.\nProperty values must not be null. Instead, you should use an optional property, e.g. foo?: string instead of foo: string | null. This limitation is due to null being used in operations to represent the absence of a property.\n\nThese default constraints are all mandated because they make working with Slate documents much more predictable.\n\n🤖 Although these constraints are the best we've come up with now, we're always looking for ways to have Slate's built-in constraints be less constraining if possible—as long as it keeps standard behaviors easy to reason about. If you come up with a way to reduce or remove a built-in constraint with a different approach, we're all ears!\n\nAdding Constraints\nThe built-in constraints are fairly generic. But you can also add your own constraints on top of the built-in ones that are specific to your domain.\nTo do this, you extend the normalizeNode function on the editor. The normalizeNode function gets called every time an operation is applied that inserts or updates a node (or its descendants), giving you the opportunity to ensure that the changes didn't leave it in an invalid state, and correcting the node if so.\nFor example here's a plugin that ensures paragraph blocks only have text or inline elements as children:\nimport { Transforms, Element, Node } from 'slate'\n\nconst withParagraphs = editor => {\n  const { normalizeNode } = editor\n\n  editor.normalizeNode = entry => {\n    const [node, path] = entry\n\n    // If the element is a paragraph, ensure its children are valid.\n    if (Element.isElement(node) && node.type === 'paragraph') {\n      for (const [child, childPath] of Node.children(editor, path)) {\n        if (Element.isElement(child) && !editor.isInline(child)) {\n          Transforms.unwrapNodes(editor, { at: childPath })\n          return\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Fall back to the original `normalizeNode` to enforce other constraints.\n    normalizeNode(entry)\n  }\n\n  return editor\n}\n\nThis example is fairly simple. Whenever normalizeNode gets called on a paragraph element, it loops through each of its children ensuring that none of them are block elements. And if one is a block element, it gets unwrapped, so that the block is removed and its children take its place. The node is \"fixed\".\nBut what if the child has nested blocks?\nMulti-pass Normalizing\nOne thing to understand about normalizeNode constraints is that they are multi-pass.\nIf you check the example above again, you'll notice the return statement:\nif (Element.isElement(child) && !editor.isInline(child)) {\n  Transforms.unwrapNodes(editor, { at: childPath })\n  return\n}\n\nYou might at first think this is odd, because with the return there, the original normalizeNodes will never be called, and the built-in constraints won't get a chance to run their own normalizations.\nBut, there's a slight \"trick\" to normalizing.\nWhen you do call Editor.unwrapNodes, you're actually changing the content of the node that is currently being normalized. So even though you're ending the current normalization pass, by making a change to the node you're kicking off a new normalization pass. This results in a sort of recursive normalizing.\nThis multi-pass characteristic makes it much easier to write normalizations, because you only ever have to worry about fixing a single issue at once, and not fixing every possible issue that could be putting a node in an invalid state.\nTo see how this works in practice, let's start with this invalid document:\n\n  \n    \n      word\n    \n  \n\n\nThe editor starts by running normalizeNode on . And it is valid, because it contains only text nodes as children.\nBut then, it moves up the tree, and runs normalizeNode on . This paragraph is invalid, since it contains a block element (). So that child block gets unwrapped, resulting in a new document of:\n\n  \n    word\n  \n\n\nAnd in performing that fix, the top-level  changed. It gets normalized, and it is invalid, so  gets unwrapped, resulting in:\n\n  word\n\n\nAnd now when normalizeNode runs, no changes are made, so the document is valid!\n\n🤖 For the most part you don't need to think about these internals. You can just know that anytime normalizeNode is called and you spot an invalid state, you can fix that single invalid state and trust that normalizeNode will be called again until the node becomes valid.\n\nEmpty Children Early Constraint Execution\nOne special normalization executes before all other normalizations and this can be important to keep in mind when writing your normalizers.\nBefore any of the other normalizations can execute, Slate iterates through all Element nodes and makes sure they have at least one child. If it does not, an empty Text descendant is created.\nThis can trip you up when you have custom handling when an Element has no children. For example, if a table element has no rows, you may wish to remove the table; however, this will never happen because a Text node would automatically be created before that normalization could run.\nIncorrect Fixes\nOne pitfall to avoid is creating an infinite normalization loop. This can happen if you check for a specific invalid structure, but then don't actually fix that structure with the change you make to the node. This results in an infinite loop because the node continues to be flagged as invalid, but it is never fixed properly.\nFor example, consider a normalization that ensured link elements have a valid url property:\n// WARNING: this is an example of incorrect behavior!\nconst withLinks = editor => {\n  const { normalizeNode } = editor\n\n  editor.normalizeNode = entry => {\n    const [node, path] = entry\n\n    if (\n      Element.isElement(node) &&\n      node.type === 'link' &&\n      typeof node.url !== 'string'\n    ) {\n      // ERROR: null is not a valid value for a url\n      Transforms.setNodes(editor, { url: null }, { at: path })\n      return\n    }\n\n    normalizeNode(entry)\n  }\n\n  return editor\n}\n\nThis fix is incorrectly written. It wants to ensure that all link elements have a url property string. But to fix invalid links it sets the url to null, which is still not a string!\nIn this case you'd either want to unwrap the link, removing it entirely. Or expand your validation to accept an \"empty\" url == null as well.\nImplications for Other Code\nSequences of Transforms may need to be wrapped in Editor.withoutNormalizing if the node tree should not be normalized between Transforms.\nThis is frequently the case when you unwrapNodes followed by wrapNodes.\nFor example, you might write a function to change the type of a block as follows:\nconst LIST_TYPES = ['numbered-list', 'bulleted-list']\n\nfunction changeBlockType(editor, type) {\n  Editor.withoutNormalizing(editor, () => {\n    const isActive = isBlockActive(editor, type)\n    const isList = LIST_TYPES.includes(type)\n\n    Transforms.unwrapNodes(editor, {\n      match: n =>\n        LIST_TYPES.includes(\n          !Editor.isEditor(n) && SlateElement.isElement(n) && n.type\n        ),\n      split: true,\n    })\n    const newProperties = {\n      type: isActive ? 'paragraph' : isList ? 'list-item' : type,\n    }\n    Transforms.setNodes(editor, newProperties)\n\n    if (!isActive && isList) {\n      const block = { type: type, children: [] }\n      Transforms.wrapNodes(editor, block)\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n"},"concepts/12-typescript.html":{"url":"concepts/12-typescript.html","title":"TypeScript","keywords":"","body":"Using TypeScript\nSlate supports typing of one Slate document model (ie. one set of custom Editor, Element and Text types). If you need to support more than one document model, see the section Multiple Document Models.\nWarning: You must define CustomTypes, annotate useState, and annotate the editor's initial state when using TypeScript or Slate will display typing errors.\nMigrating from 0.47.x\nWhen migrating from 0.47.x, read the guide below first. Also keep in mind these common migration issues:\n\nWhen referring to node.type, you may see the error Property 'type' does not exist on type 'Node'. To fix this, you need to add code like Element.isElement(node) && node.type === 'paragraph'. This is necessary because a Node can be an Element or Text and Text does not have a type property.\nBe careful when you define the CustomType for Editor. Make sure to define the CustomType for Editor as BaseEditor & .... It should not be Editor & ...\n\nDefining Editor, Element and Text Types\nTo define a custom Element or Text type, extend the CustomTypes interface in the slate module like this.\n// This example is for an Editor with `ReactEditor` and `HistoryEditor`\nimport { BaseEditor } from 'slate'\nimport { ReactEditor } from 'slate-react'\nimport { HistoryEditor } from 'slate-history'\n\ntype CustomElement = { type: 'paragraph'; children: CustomText[] }\ntype CustomText = { text: string; bold?: true }\n\ndeclare module 'slate' {\n  interface CustomTypes {\n    Editor: BaseEditor & ReactEditor & HistoryEditor\n    Element: CustomElement\n    Text: CustomText\n  }\n}\n\nAnnotations in the Editor\nAnnotate the editor's initial value w/ Descendant[].\nimport React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react'\nimport { createEditor, Descendant } from 'slate'\nimport { Slate, Editable, withReact } from 'slate-react'\n\nconst initialValue: Descendant[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'paragraph',\n    children: [{ text: 'A line of text in a paragraph.' }],\n  },\n]\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const editor = useMemo(() => withReact(createEditor()), [])\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nBest Practices for Element and Text Types\nWhile you can define types directly in the CustomTypes interface, best practice is to define and export each type separately so that you can reference individual types like a ParagraphElement.\nUsing best practices, the custom types might look something like:\n// This example is for an Editor with `ReactEditor` and `HistoryEditor`\nimport { BaseEditor } from 'slate'\nimport { ReactEditor } from 'slate-react'\nimport { HistoryEditor } from 'slate-history'\n\nexport type CustomEditor = BaseEditor & ReactEditor & HistoryEditor\n\nexport type ParagraphElement = {\n  type: 'paragraph'\n  children: CustomText[]\n}\n\nexport type HeadingElement = {\n  type: 'heading'\n  level: number\n  children: CustomText[]\n}\n\nexport type CustomElement = ParagraphElement | HeadingElement\n\nexport type FormattedText = { text: string; bold?: true }\n\nexport type CustomText = FormattedText\n\ndeclare module 'slate' {\n  interface CustomTypes {\n    Editor: CustomEditor\n    Element: CustomElement\n    Text: CustomText\n  }\n}\n\nIn this example, CustomText is equal to FormattedText but in a real editor, there can be more types of text like text in a code block which may not allow formatting for example.\nWhy Is The Type Definition Unusual\nBecause it gets asked often, this section explains why Slate's type definition is atypical.\nSlate needs to support a feature called type discrimination which is available when using union types (e.g. ParagraphElement | HeadingElement). This allows a user to narrow a type. If presented with code like if (node.type === 'paragraph') { ... } the inside of the block, will narrow the type of node to ParagraphElement.\nSlate also needs a way to allow developers to get their custom types into Slate. This is done through declaration merging which is a feature of an interface.\nSlate combines a union type and an interface in order to use both features.\nFor more information see Proposal: Add Custom TypeScript Types to Slate\nMultiple Document Models\nAt the moment, Slate supports types for a single document model at a time. For example, it cannot support two different Rich Text Editor with different document schemas.\nSlate's TypeScript support was designed this way because typing for one document schema was better than none. The goal is to eventually support typing for multiple editor definitions and there is currently an in progress PR built by the creator of Slate.\nOne workaround for supporting multiple document models is to create each editor in a separate package and then import them. This hasn't been tested but should work.\nExtending Other Types\nCurrently there is also support for extending other types but these haven't been tested as thoroughly as the ones documented above:\n\nSelection\nRange\nPoint\n\nFeel free to extend these types but extending these types should be considered experimental. Please report bugs on GitHub issues.\nTypeScript Examples\nFor some examples of how to use types, see packages/slate-react/src/custom-types.ts in the slate repository.\n"},"concepts/xx-migrating.html":{"url":"concepts/xx-migrating.html","title":"Migrating","keywords":"","body":"Migrating\nMigrating from earlier versions of Slate to the 0.50.x versions is not a simple task. The entire framework was re-considered from the ground up. This has resulted in a much better set of abstractions, which will result in you writing less code. But the migration process is not simple.\nIt's highly recommended that after reading this guide you read through the original Walkthroughs and the other Concepts to see how all of the new concepts get applied.\nMajor Differences\nHere's an overview of the major differences in the 0.50.x version of Slate from an architectural point of view.\nJSON!\nThe data model is now comprised of simple JSON objects. Previously, it used Immutable.js data structures. This is a huge change, and one that unlocks many other things. Hopefully it will also increase the average performance when using Slate. It also makes it much easier to get started for newcomers. This will be a large change to migrate from, but it will be worth it.\nInterfaces\nThe data model is interface-based. Previously each model was an instance of a class. Now, not only is the data plain objects, but Slate only expects that the objects implement an interface. So custom properties that used to live in node.data can now live at the top-level of the nodes.\nNamespaces\nA lot of helper functions are exposed as a collection of helper functions on a namespace. For example, Node.get(root, path) or Range.isCollapsed(range). This ends up making code much clearer because you can always quickly see what interface you're working with.\nTypeScript\nThe codebase now uses TypeScript. Working with pure JSON as a data model, and using an interface-based API are two things that have been made easier by migrating to TypeScript. You don't need to use it yourself, but if you do you'll get a lot more security when using the APIs. (And if you use VS Code you'll get nice autocompletion regardless!)\nFewer Concepts\nThe number of interfaces and commands has been reduced. Previously Selection, Annotation, and Decoration used to all be separate classes. Now they are simply objects that implement the Range interface. Previously Block and Inline were separate; now they are objects that implement the Element interface. Previously there was a Document and Value, but now the top-level Editor contains the children nodes of the document itself.\nThe number of commands has been reduced too. Previously we had commands for every type of input, like insertText, insertTextAtRange, insertTextAtPath. These have been merged into a smaller set of more customizable commands, eg. insertText which can take at: Path | Range | Point.\nFewer Packages\nIn an attempt to decrease the maintenance burden, and because the new abstraction and APIs in Slate's core packages make things much easier, the total number of packages has been reduced. Things like slate-plain-serializer, slate-base64-serializer, etc. have been removed and can be implemented in userland easily if needed. Even the slate-html-deserializer can now be implemented in userland (in ~10 LOC leveraging slate-hyperscript). And internal packages like slate-dev-environment, slate-dev-test-utils, etc. are no longer exposed because they are implementation details.\nCommands\nA new \"command\" concept has been introduced. (The old \"commands\" are now called \"transforms\".) This new concept expresses the semantic intent of a user editing the document. And they allow for the right abstraction to tap into user behaviors—for example to change what happens when a user presses enter, or backspace, etc. Instead of using keydown events you should likely override command behaviors instead.\nCommands are triggered by calling the editor.* core functions. And they travel through a middleware-like stack, but built from composed functions. Any plugin can override the behaviors to augment an editor.\nPlugins\nPlugins are now plain functions that augment the Editor object they receive and return it again. For example, they can augment the command execution by composing the editor.exec function or listen to operations by composing editor.apply. Previously they relied on a custom middleware stack, and they were just bags of handlers that got merged onto an editor. Now we're using plain old function composition (aka wrapping) instead.\nElements\nBlock-ness and inline-ness is now a runtime choice. Previously it was baked into the data model with the object: 'block' or object: 'inline' attributes. Now, it checks whether an \"element\" is inline or not at runtime. For example, you might check to see that element.type === 'link' and treat it as inline.\nMore React-ish\nRendering and event-handling are no longer a plugin's concern. Previously plugins had full control over the rendering and event-handling logic in the editor. This creates a bad incentive to start putting all rendering logic in plugins, which puts Slate in a position of being a wrapper around all of React, which is very hard to do well. Instead, the new architecture has plugins focused purely on the richtext aspects, and leaves the rendering and event handling aspects to React.\nContext\nPreviously the  component was doing double duty as a sort of \"controller\" object and also the contenteditable DOM element. This led to a lot of awkwardness in how other components worked with Slate. In the new version, there is a new  context provider and a simpler  contenteditable-like component. By putting the  provider higher up in your component tree, you can share the editor directly with toolbars, buttons, etc. using the useSlate hook.\nHooks\nIn addition to the useSlate hook, there are a handful of other hooks. For example the useSelected and useFocused hooks help with knowing when to render selected states (often for void nodes). And since they use React's Context API they will automatically re-render when their state changes.\nbeforeinput\nWe now use the beforeinput event almost exclusively. Instead of relying on a series of shims and the quirks of React synthetic events, we're now using the standardized beforeinput event as our baseline. It is fully supported in Safari and Chrome, will soon be supported in the new Chromium-based Edge, and is currently being worked on in Firefox. In the meantime there are a few patches to make Firefox work. Internet Explorer is no longer supported in core out of the box.\nHistory-less\nThe core history logic has now finally been extracted into a standalone plugin. This makes it much easier for people to implement their own custom history behaviors. And it ensures that plugins have enough control to augment the editor in complex ways, because the history requires it.\nMark-less\nMarks have been removed from the Slate data model. Now that we have the ability to define custom properties right on the nodes themselves, you can model marks as custom properties of text nodes. For example bold can be modelled simply as a bold: true property.\nAnnotation-less\nSimilarly, annotations have been removed from Slate's core. They can be fully implemented now in userland by defining custom operations and rendering annotated ranges using decorations. But most cases should be using custom text node properties or decorations anyways. There were not that many use cases that benefited from annotations.\nReductions\nOne of the goals was to dramatically simplify a lot of the logic in Slate to make it easier to maintain and iterate on. This was done by refactoring to better base abstractions that can be built on, by leveraging modern DOM APIs, and by migrating to simpler React patterns.\nTo give you a sense for the change in total lines of code:\nslate                       8,436  ->  3,958  (47%)\nslate-react                 3,905  ->  1,954  (50%)\n\nslate-base64-serializer        38  ->      0\nslate-dev-benchmark           340  ->      0\nslate-dev-environment         102  ->      0\nslate-dev-test-utils           44  ->      0\nslate-history                   0  ->    211\nslate-hotkeys                  62  ->      0\nslate-html-serializer         253  ->      0\nslate-hyperscript             447  ->    345\nslate-plain-serializer         56  ->      0\nslate-prop-types               62  ->      0\nslate-react-placeholder        62  ->      0\n\ntotal                      13,807  ->  6,468  (47%)\n\nIt's quite a big difference!

For example, it does not \"unhang\" a selection that starts at the end of a previous block.\nIt only does anything if the start block is fully selected.

The affinity refers to the direction the RangeRef will go when a user inserts content at the edges of the Range. inward means that the Range tends to stay the same size when content is inserted at its edges, and outward meaans that the Range tends to grow when content is inserted at its edges.\ninterface RangeRef {\n  current: Range | null\n  affinity: 'forward' | 'backward' | 'outward' | 'inward' | null\n  unref(): Range | null\n}\n\nFor example:\nconst selectionRef = Editor.rangeRef(editor, editor.selection, {\n  affinity: 'inward',\n})\n// Allow the user to do stuff which might change the selection\nTransforms.unwrapNodes(editor)\nTransforms.select(editor, selectionRef.unRef())\n\n\nInstance methods\nStatic methods\nTransform methods\n\n\n\nInstance methods\nunRef() => Range\nCall this when you no longer need to sync this range.\nIt also returns the current value.\nStatic methods\nTransform methods\nRangeRef.transform(ref: RangeRef, op: Operation)\nTransform the range refs current value by an op.\nThe editor calls this as needed, so normally you won't need to.\n"},"api/locations/span.html":{"url":"api/locations/span.html","title":"Span","keywords":"","body":"Span API\nA Span is a low-level way to refer to a Range using Element as the end points instead of a Point which requires the use of leaf text nodes.\ntype Span = [Path, Path]\n\n\nStatic methods\nCheck methods\n\n\n\nStatic Methods\nCheck Methods\nSpan.isSpan(value: any) => value is Span\nCheck if a value implements the Span interface.\n"},"api/operation.html":{"url":"api/operation.html","title":"Operation","keywords":"","body":"Operation API\nOperation objects define the low-level instructions that Slate editors use to apply changes to their internal state.

We close questions in issues so that maintaining the project isn't overwhelming.\nSubmitting Pull Requests\nAll pull requests are super welcomed and greatly appreciated! Issues in need of a solution are marked with a ♥ help label if you're looking for somewhere to start.\nPlease include tests and docs with every pull request!\nRepository Setup\nThe slate repository is a monorepo that is managed with lerna. Unlike more traditional repositories, this means that the repository must be built in order for tests, linting, or other common development activities to function as expected.\nTo run the build, you need to have the Slate repository cloned to your computer. After that, you need to cd into the directory where you cloned it, and install the dependencies with yarn and build the monorepo:\nyarn install\nyarn build\n\nRunning Examples\nTo run the examples, start by building the monorepo as described in the Repository Setup section.\nThen you can start the examples server with:\nyarn start\n\nRunning Tests\nTo run the tests, start by building the monorepo as described in the Repository Setup section.\nThen you can rerun the tests with:\nyarn test\n\nIf you need to debug something, you can add a debugger line to the source, and then run yarn test:inspect.\nIf you only want to run a specific test or tests, you can run yarn test --fgrep=\"slate-react rendering\" flag which will filter the tests being run by grepping for the string in each test. (This is a Mocha flag that gets passed through.)\nIn addition to tests you should also run the linter:\nyarn lint\n\nThis will catch TypeScript, Prettier, and Eslint errors.\nyarn fix\n\nThis will fix Prettier and Eslint errors.\nRunning integration tests\nTo run integrations with cypress, first run yarn start to run the examples website, then run yarn cypress:open in a separate session to open the cypress GUI.\nTesting Input Methods\nHere's a helpful page detailing how to test various input scenarios on Windows, Mac and Linux.\nPublishing Releases\nImportant: When creating releases using Lerna with the instructions below, you will be given choices around how to increase version numbers. You should always use a major, minor or patch release and must never use a prerelease. If a prerelease is used, the root package will not link to the packages in the packages directory creating hard to diagnose issues.\nPublishing Normal @latest Release\nSince we use Lerna to manage the Slate packages this is fairly easy, just run:\nyarn release:latest\n\nAnd follow the prompts Lerna gives you.\nNote that this will automatically run the prelease script first that will build, test and lint before attempting to publish.\nPublishing @next Release\nIf we are unsure as to the stability of a release because there are significant changes and/or particularly complex changes, release with the @next tag.\nyarn release:next\n\nAnd follow the prompts Lerna gives you.\nPublishing @experimental Release\nIf you need to create an experimental release to see how a published package will behave during an actual publish, release with the @experimental tag. End users should have no expectation that an @experimental release will be usable.\nyarn release:experimental\n\nRunning Prerelease Script\nIf we want to make sure that Slate code follows the preparations for a release but without actually publishing, run:\nyarn prerelease\n\nWhich will build, test and lint Slate code.\n"},"general/changelog.html":{"url":"general/changelog.html","title":"Changelog","keywords":"","body":"Changelog\nThis is a list of changes to Slate with each new release.

Improved typing with TypeScript lets you add CustomTypes for the Slate Editor. This change requires you to set up your types at the start. It's a new concept so please read the new TypeScript documentation here: https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/11-typescript\n0.60 — November 24, 2020\nBREAKING\nIntroduced new customizable TypeScript typings. You can override the built-in types to extend them for your own editor's domain model. However the changes to make this possible likely resulted in some changes to the existing type contracts.\nThe useEditor hook was renamed to useSlateStatic. This was done to better differentiate between the useSlate hook and to make it clear that the static version will not re-render when changes occur.\n0.59 — September 24, 2020\nThere were no breaking changes or new additions in this release.\n0.58 — May 5th, 2020\nBREAKING\nUser properties on Elements and Texts now have an unknown type instead of any. Previously, the arbitrary user defined keys on the Text and Element interface had a type of any which effectively removed any potential type checking on those properties. Now these have a type of unknown so that type checking can be done by consumers of the API when they are applying their own custom properties to the Texts and Elements.\n0.57 — December 18, 2019\nBREAKING\nOverridable commands now live directly on the editor object. Previously the Command concept was implemented as an interface that was passed into the editor.exec function, allowing the \"core\" commands to be overridden in one place. But this introduced a lot of Redux-like indirection when implementing custom commands that wasn't necessary because they are never overridden. Instead, now the core actions that can be overridden are implemented as individual functions on the editor (eg. editor.insertText) and they can be overridden just like any other function (eg. isVoid).\nPreviously to override a command you'd do:\nconst withPlugin = editor => {\n  const { exec } = editor\n\n  editor.exec = command => {\n    if (command.type === 'insert_text') {\n      const { text } = command\n\n      if (myCustomLogic) {\n        // ...\n        return\n      }\n    }\n\n    exec(command)\n  }\n\n  return editor\n}\n\nNow, you'd override the specific function directly:\nconst withPlugin = editor => {\n  const { insertText } = editor\n\n  editor.insertText = text => {\n    if (myCustomLogic) {\n      // ...\n      return\n    }\n\n    insertText(text)\n  }\n\n  return editor\n}\n\nYou shouldn't ever need to call these functions directly! They are there for plugins to tap into, but there are higher level helpers for you to call whenever you actually need to invoke them. Read on…\nTransforms now live in a separate namespace of helpers. Previously the document and selection transformation helpers were available directly on the Editor interface as Editor.*. But these helpers are fairly low level, and not something that you'd use in your own codebase all over the place, usually only inside specific custom helpers of your own. To make room for custom userland commands, these helpers have been moved to a new Transforms namespace.\nPreviously you'd write:\nEditor.unwrapNodes(editor, ...)\n\nNow you'd write:\nTransforms.unwrapNodes(editor, ...)\n\nThe Command interfaces were removed. As part of those changes, the existing Command, CoreCommand, HistoryCommand, and ReactCommand interfaces were all removed. You no longer need to define these \"command objects\", because you can just call the functions directly. Plugins can still define their own overridable commands by extending the Editor interface with new functions. The slate-react plugin does this with insertData and the slate-history plugin does this with undo and redo.\nNEW\nUser action helpers now live directly on the Editor.* interface. These are taking the place of the existing Transforms.* helpers that were moved. These helpers are equivalent to user actions, and they always operate on the existing selection. There are some defined by core, but you are likely to define your own custom helpers that are specific to your domain as well.\nFor example, here are some of the built-in actions:\nEditor.insertText(editor, 'a string of text')\nEditor.deleteForward(editor)\nEditor.deleteBackward(editor, { unit: 'word' })\nEditor.addMark(editor, 'bold', true)\nEditor.insertBreak(editor)\n...\n\nEvery one of the old \"core commands\" has an equivalent Editor.* helper exposed now. However, you can easily define your own custom helpers and place them in a namespace as well:\nconst MyEditor = {\n  ...Editor,\n  insertParagraph(editor) { ... },\n  toggleBoldMark(editor) { ... },\n  formatLink(editor, url) { ... },\n  ...\n}\n\nWhatever makes sense for your specific use case!\n0.56 — December 17, 2019\nBREAKING\nThe format_text command is split into add_mark and remove_mark. Although the goal is to keep the number of commands in core to a minimum, having this as a combined command made it very hard to write logic that wanted to guarantee to only ever add or remove a mark from a text node. Now you can be guaranteed that the add_mark command will only ever add custom properties to text nodes, and the remove_mark command will only ever remove them.\nPreviously you would write:\neditor.exec({\n  type: 'format_text',\n  properties: { bold: true },\n})\n\nNow you would write:\nif (isActive) {\n  editor.exec({ type: 'remove_mark', key: 'bold' })\n} else {\n  editor.exec({ type: 'add_mark', key: 'bold', value: true })\n}\n\n\n🤖 Note that the \"mark\" term does not mean what it meant in 0.47 and earlier. It simply means formatting that is applied at the text level—bold, italic, etc. We need a term for it because it's such a common pattern in richtext editors, and \"mark\" is often the term that is used. For example the  tag in HTML.\n\nThe Node.text helper was renamed to Node.string. This was simply to reduce the confusion between \"the text string\" and \"text nodes\". The helper still just returns the concatenated string content of a node.\n0.55 — December 15, 2019\nBREAKING\nThe match option must now be a function. Previously there were a few shorthands, like passing in a plain object. This behavior was removed because it made it harder to reason about exactly what was being matched, it made debugging harder, and it made it hard to type well. Now the match option must be a function that receives the Node object to match. If you're using TypeScript, and the function you pass in is a type guard, that will be taken into account in the return value!\nPreviously you might write:\nEditor.nodes(editor, {\n  at: range,\n  match: 'text',\n})\n\nEditor.nodes(editor, {\n  at: range,\n  match: { type: 'paragraph' },\n})\n\nNow you'd write:\nEditor.nodes(editor, {\n  at: range,\n  match: Text.isText,\n})\n\nEditor.nodes(editor, {\n  at: range,\n  match: node => node.type === 'paragraph',\n})\n\nThe mode option now defaults to 'lowest'. Previously the default varied depending on where in the codebase it was used. Now it defaults to 'lowest' everywhere, and you can always pass in 'highest' to change the behavior. The one exception is the Editor.nodes helper which defaults to 'all' since that's the expected behavior most of the time.\nThe Editor.match helper was renamed to Editor.above. This was just to make it clear how it searched in the tree—it looks through all of the nodes directly above a location in the document.\nThe Editor.above/previous/next helpers now take all options in a dictionary. Previously their APIs did not exactly match the Editor.nodes helper which they are shorthand for, but now this is no longer the case. The at, match and mode options are all passed in the options argument.\nPreviously you would use:\nEditor.previous(editor, path, n => Text.isText(n), {\n  mode: 'lowest',\n})\n\nNow you'd use:\nEditor.previous(editor, {\n  at: path,\n  match: n => Text.isText(n),\n  mode: 'lowest',\n  ...\n})\n\nThe Editor.elements and Editor.texts helpers were removed. These were simple convenience helpers that were rarely used. You can now achieve the same thing by using the Editor.nodes helper directly along with the match option. For example:\nEditor.nodes(editor, {\n  at: range,\n  match: Element.isElement,\n})\n\n0.54 — December 12, 2019\nBREAKING\nThe  onChange handler no longer receives the selection argument. Previously it received (value, selection), now it receives simply (value). Instead, you can access any property of the editor directly (including the value as editor.children). The value/onChange convention is provided purely for form-related use cases that expect it. This is along with the change to how extra props are \"controlled\". By default they are uncontrolled, but you can pass in any of the other top-level editor properties to take control of them.\nThe Command and CoreCommand interfaces have been split apart. Previously you could access Command.isCoreCommand, however now this helper lives directly on the core command interface as CoreCommand.isCoreCommand. This makes it more symmetrical with userland commands.\nCommand checkers have been simplified. Previously Slate exposed command-checking helpers like Command.isInsertTextCommand. However these were verbose and not useful most of the time. Instead, you can now check for CoreCommand.isCoreCommand and then use the command.type property to narrow further. This keeps core more symmetrical with how userland will implement custom commands.\nNEW\nThe  component is now pseudo-controlled. It requires a value= prop to be passed in which is controlled. However, the selection, marks, history, or any other props are not required to be controlled. They default to being uncontrolled. If your use case requires controlling these extra props you can pass them in and they will start being controlled again. This change was made to make using Slate easier, while still allowing for more complex state to be controlled by core or plugins going forward—state that users don't need to concern themselves with most of time.\nThe Editor now has a marks property. This property represents text-level formatting that will be applied to the next character that is inserted. This is a common richtext editor behavior, where pressing a Bold button with a collapsed selection turns on \"bold\" formatting mode, and then typing a character becomes bold. This state isn't stored in the document, and is instead stored as an extra property on the editor itself.\n0.53 — December 10, 2019\nBREAKING\nThe slate-schema package has been removed! This decision was made because with the new helpers on the Editor.* interface, and with the changes to normalizeNode in the latest version of Slate, adding constraints using normalizeNode actually leads to more maintainable code than using slate-schema. Previously it was required to keep things from getting too unreadable, but that always came at a large cost of indirection and learning additional APIs. Everything you could do with slate-schema you can do with normalizeNode, and more.\nNode matching functions now receive just a Node. Previously they received a NodeEntry tuple, which consisted of [node, path]. However now they receive only a node argument, which makes it easier to write one-off node-checking helpers and pass them in directly as arguments. If you need to ensure a path, lookup the node first.\nA few unnecessary helpers were removed. There were a handful of leftovers helpers that were not used anywhere in Slate's core logic, and were very unlikely to be used in userland, so they've been removed to reduce bundle size. You are always free to re-implement them if you truly need them. The list of helpers removed is:\n\nEditor.ancestor\nNode.closest\nNode.furthest\nRange.exists\nRange.isRangeList\nRange.isRangeMap\n\n0.52 — December 5, 2019\nBREAKING\nThe slate-schema package now exports a factory. Previously you imported the withSchema function directly from the package, and passed in your schema rules when you called it. However, now you import the defineSchema factory instead which takes your schema rules and returns a custom withSchema plugin function. This way you can still use helpers like compose with the plugin, while pre-defining your custom rules.\nThe properties validation in the schema is now exhaustive. Previously a properties validation would check any properties you defined, and leave any unknown ones as is. This made it hard to be certain about which properties would end up on a node. Now any non-defined properties are considered invalid. And using an empty {} validation would ensure that there are no custom properties at all.\nNEW\nThe leaves schema validation ensures text-level formatting. You can use it from any higher up element node in the tree, to guarantee that it only contains certain types of text-level formatting on its inner text nodes. For example you could use it to ensure that a code block doesn't allow any of its text to be bolded or italicized.\n0.51 — December 5, 2019\nBREAKING\nThe Mark interface has been removed! Previously text-level formatting was stored in an array of unique marks. Now that same formatting is stored directly on the Text nodes themselves. For example instead of:\n{\n  text: 'A line of text.',\n  marks: [{ type: 'bold' }],\n}\n\nYou now have:\n{\n  text: 'A line of text.',\n  bold: true,\n}\n\nAnd the marks are added and removed from the text nodes using the same Editor.setNodes transform that you use for toggling formatting on block and inline nodes. This greatly simplifies things and makes Slate's core even smaller.\nThe  component is now a \"controlled\" component. This makes things a bit more React-ish, and makes it easier to update the editor's value when new data is received after the initial render. To arrive at the previous \"uncontrolled\" behavior you'll need to implement it in userland using React's built-in hooks.\nWhereas previously you would do:\n...\n\nNow you must manage the value and selection yourself, like:\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)\nconst [selection, setSelection] = useState(null)\n\n {\n    setValue(value)\n    setSelection(selection)\n  }}\n>\n  ...\n\n\n0.50 — November 27, 2019\nBREAKING\nA complete overhaul. The Slate codebase has had a complete overhaul and many pieces of its core architecture have been reconsidered from the ground up. There are lots of changes. We recommend re-reading the Walkthroughs and Concepts documentation and the Examples to get a sense for everything that has changed. As well as the Migration writeup for what the major changes are.\n\n⚠ Warning: Changes past this point refer to the older Slate architecture, based on Immutable.js and without TypeScript. Many things are different in the older architecture and may not apply to the newer one.\n\n0.47 — May 8, 2019\nNEW\nIntroducing the Annotation model. This is very similar to what used to be stored in value.decorations, except they also contain a unique \"key\" to be identified by. They can be used for things like comments, suggestions, collaborative cursors, etc.\n{\n  object: 'annotation',\n  key: String,\n  type: String,\n  data: Map,\n  anchor: Point,\n  focus: Point,\n}\n\nThere are three new *_annotation operations. The set of operations now includes add_annotation, remove_annotation and set_annotation. They are similar to the existing *_mark operations.\nIntroducing \"iterable\" model methods. This introduces several iteratable-producing methods on the Element interface, which Document, Block and Inline all implement. There are iterables for traversing the entire tree:\nelement.blocks(options)\nelement.descendants(options)\nelement.inlines(options)\nelement.texts(options)\n\nelement.ancestors(path, options)\nelement.siblings(path, options)\n\nYou can use them just like the native JavaScript iterables. For example, you can loop through the text nodes after a specific node:\nfor (const next of document.texts({ path: start.path })) {\n  const [node, path] = next\n  // do something with the text node or its path\n}\n\nOr you can traverse all of the \"leaf\" blocks:\nfor (const [block] of document.blocks({ onlyLeaves: true })) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nAnd because these iterations use native for/of loops, you can easily break or return out of the loops directly—a much nicer DX than remembering to return false.\nBREAKING\nThe value.decorations property is now value.annotations. Following with the split of decorations into annotations, this property was also renamed. They must now contain unique key properties, as they are stored as a Map instead of a List. This allows for much more performant updates.\nThe Decoration model no longer has a nested mark property. Previously a real Mark object was used as a property on decorations, but now the type and data properties are first class properties instead.\n{\n  object: 'decoration',\n  type: String,\n  data: Map,\n  anchor: Point,\n  focus: Point,\n}\n\n0.46 — May 1, 2019\nBREAKING\nMark operations no longer have offset or length properties. Since text nodes now contain a unique set of marks, it wouldn't make sense for a single mark-related operation to result in a splitting of nodes. Instead, when a mark is added to only part of a text node, it will result in a split_node operation as well as an add_mark operation.\nText operations no longer have a marks property. Previously it was used to add text with a specific set of marks. However this is no longer necessary, and when text is added with marks it will result in an insert_text operation as well as an add_mark operation.\nUsing Text.create or Text.createList with a leaves property will error. Now that text nodes no longer have leaves, you will need to pass in the text string and marks directly when creating a new text node. (However, you can still create entire values using Value.create in a backwards compatible way for convenience while migrating.)\n// This works, although deprecated, which is the common case...\nValue.create(oldValueJson)\n\n// ...but this will error!\nText.create(oldTextJson)\n\nValue.toJSON returns the new data model format, without leaves. Although Value.fromJSON and Value.create allow the old format in deprecated mode, calling Value.toJSON will return the new data format. If you still need the old one you'll need to iterate the document tree converting text nodes yourself.\nThe low-level Value.* and Node.* mutation methods have changed. These changes follow the operation signature changes, since the methods take the same arguments as the operations themselves. For example:\n// Previously...\nvalue.addMark(path, offset, length, mark)\n\n// ...is now:\nvalue.addMark(path, mark)\n\nThese are low-level methods, so this change shouldn't affect the majority of use cases.\nDEPRECATED\nInitializing editors with Text nodes with a leaves property is deprecated. In this new version of Slate, creating a new value with Value.create with the old leaf data model is still allowed for convenience in migration, but it will be removed in a coming version. (However, using the low-level Text.create will throw an error!)\n// This works, although deprecated, which is the common case...\nValue.create(oldValueJson)\n\n// ...but this will error!\nText.create(oldTextJson)\n\n0.45 — April 2, 2019\nBREAKING\nA few properties of Operation objects have changed. In an effort to standardize and streamline operations, their properties have changed. This won't affect 90% of use cases, since operations are usually low-level concerns. However, if you are using operational transform or some other low-level parts of Slate, this may affect you. The value, selection, node, and mark properties—which contained references to Immutable.js objects—have all been removed. In their place, we have standardized a properties and newProperties pair. This will greatly reduce the size of operations stored in memory, and makes dealing with them easier when serialized as well.\n0.44 — November 8, 2018\nNEW\nIntroducing the child_min_invalid and child_max_invalid schema errors. These new schema errors map directly to the mix and max schema rule definitions, and make it easier to determine exactly what your normalization logic needs to do to fix the document.\nAdded new node retrieval methods. There are three new methdos for node retrieval. The first is getNodesAtRange which will retrieve all of the nodes in the tree in a given range. And the second two are getRootBlocksAtRange and getRootInlinesAtRange for retrieving the top-most blocks or inlines in a given range. These should be helpful in defining your own command logic.\nBREAKING\nSchema errors for min and max rules have changed. Previously they would result in errors of child_required, child_object_invalid, child_type_invalid and child_unknown. Now that we have the new child_min_invalid and child_max_invalid errors, these schema rules will return them instead, making it much easier to determine exactly which rule is causing a schema error.\nDEPRECATED\nThe getBlocksAtRange and getInlinesAtRange methods have been renamed. To clear up confusion about which blocks and inlines are retrieve in the case of nesting, these two methods have been renamed to getLeafBlocksAtRange and getLeafInlinesAtRange to clarify that they retrieve the bottom-most nodes. And now there are two additional methods called getRootBlocksAtRange and getRootInlinesAtRange for cases where you want the top-most nodes instead.\n0.43 — October 27, 2018\nNEW\nThe editor.command and editor.query methods can take functions. Previously they only accepted a type string and would look up the command or query by type. Now, they also accept a custom function. This is helpful for plugin authors, who want to accept a \"command option\", since it gives users more flexibility to write one-off commands or queries. For example a plugin could be passed either:\nHotkey({\n  hotkey: 'cmd+b',\n  command: 'addBoldMark',\n})\n\nOr a custom command function:\nHotkey({\n  hotkey: 'cmd+b',\n  command: editor => editor.addBoldMark().moveToEnd(),\n})\n\nBREAKING\nThe Change object has been removed. The Change object as we know it previously has been removed, and all of its behaviors have been folded into the Editor controller. This includes the top-level commands and queries methods, as well as methods like applyOperation and normalize. All places that used to receive change now receive editor, which is API equivalent.\nChanges are now flushed to onChange asynchronously. Previously this was done synchronously, which resulted in some strange race conditions in React environments. Now they will always be flushed asynchronously, just like setState.\nThe normalize* and validate* middleware signatures have changed! Previously the normalize* and validate* middleware was passed (node, next). However now, for consistency with the other middleware they are all passed (node, editor, next). This way, all middleware always receive editor and next as their final two arguments.\nThe editor.event method has been removed. Previously this is what you'd use when writing tests to simulate events being fired—which were slightly different to other running other middleware. With the simplification to the editor and to the newly-consistent middleware signatures, you can now use editor.run directly to simulate events:\neditor.run('onKeyDown', { key: 'Tab', ... })\n\nDEPRECATED\nThe editor.change method is deprecated. With the removal of the Change object, there's no need anymore to create the small closures with editor.change(). Instead you can directly invoke commands on the editor in series, and all of the changes will be emitted asynchronously on the next tick.\neditor\n  .insertText('word')\n  .moveFocusForward(10)\n  .addMark('bold')\n\nThe applyOperations method is deprecated. Instead you can loop a set of operations and apply each one using applyOperation. This is to reduce the number of methods exposed on the Editor to keep it simpler.\nThe change.call method is deprecated. Previously this was used to call a one-off function as a change method. Now this behavior is equivalent to calling editor.command(fn) instead.\n0.42 — October 9, 2018\nNEW\nIntroducing the Editor controller. Previously there was a vague editor concept, that was the React component itself. This was helpful, but because it was tightly coupled to React and the browser, it didn't lend itself to non-browser use cases well. This meant that the line between \"model\" and \"controller/view\" was blurred, and some concepts lived in both places at once, in inconsistent ways.\nA new Editor controller now makes this relationship clear. It borrows many of its behaviors from the React  component. And the component actually just instantiates its own plain JavaScript Editor under the covers to delegate the work to.\nThis new concept powers a lot of the thinking in this new version, unlocking a lot of changes that bring a clearer separation of responsibilities to Slate. It allows us to create editors in any environment, which makes server-side use cases easier, brings parity to testing, and even opens us up to supporting other view layers like React Native or Vue.js in the future.\nIt has a familiar API, based on the existing editor concept:\nconst editor = new Editor({ plugins, value, onChange })\n\neditor.change(change => {\n  ...\n})\n\nHowever it also introduces imperative methods to make testing easier:\neditor.run('renderNode', props)\n\neditor.event('onKeyDown', event)\n\neditor.command('addMark', 'bold')\n\neditor.query('isVoid', node)\n\nI'm very excited about it, so I hope you like it!\nIntroducing the \"commands\" concept. Previously, \"change methods\" were treated in a first-class way, but plugins had no easy way to add their own change methods that were reusable elsewhere. And they had no way to override the built-in logic for certain commands, for example splitBlock or insertText. However, now this is all customizable by plugins, with the core Slate plugin providing all of the previous default commands.\nconst plugin = {\n  commands: {\n    wrapQuote(change) {\n      change.wrapBlock('quote')\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nThose commands are then available directly on the change objects, which are now editor-specific:\nchange.wrapQuote()\n\nThis allows you to define all of your commands in a single, easily-testable place. And then \"behavioral\" plugins can simply take command names as options, so that you have full control over the logic they trigger.\nIntroducing the \"queries\" concept. Similarly to the commands, queries allow plugins to define specific behaviors that the editor can be queried for in a reusable way, to be used when rendering buttons, or deciding on command behaviors, etc.\nFor example, you might define an getActiveList query:\nconst plugin = {\n  queries: {\n    getActiveList(editor) {},\n  },\n}\n\nAnd then be able to re-use that logic easily in different places in your codebase, or pass in the query name to a plugin that can use your custom logic itself:\nconst list = change.getActiveList()\n\nif (list) {\n  ...\n} else {\n  ...\n}\n\nTaken together, commands and queries offer a better way for plugins to manage their inter-dependencies. They can take in command or query names as options to change their behaviors, or they can export new commands and queries that you can reuse in your codebase.\nThe middleware stack is now deferrable. With the introduction of the Editor controller, the middleware stack in Slate has also been upgraded. Each middleware now receives a next function (similar to Express or Koa) that allows you to choose whether to iterating the stack or not.\n// Previously, you'd return `undefined` to continue.\nfunction onKeyDown(event, editor, next) {\n  if (event.key !== 'Enter') return\n  ...\n}\n\n// Now, you call `next()` to continue...\nfunction onKeyDown(event, editor, next) {\n  if (event.key !== 'Enter') return next()\n  ...\n}\n\nWhile that may seem inconvenient, it opens up an entire new behavior, which is deferring to the plugins later in the stack to see if they \"handle\" a specific case, and if not, handling it yourself:\nfunction onKeyDown(event, editor, next) {\n  if (event.key === 'Enter') {\n    const handled = next()\n    if (handled) return handled\n\n    // Otherwise, handle `Enter` yourself...\n  }\n}\n\nThis is how all of the core logic in slate-react is now implemented, eliminating the need for a \"before\" and an \"after\" plugin that duplicate logic.\nUnder the covers, the schema, commands and queries concept are all implemented as plugins that attach varying middleware as well. For example, commands are processed using the onCommand middleware under the covers:\nconst plugin = {\n  onCommand(command, editor, next) {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nThis allows you to actually listen in to all commands, and override individual behaviors if you choose to do so, without having to override the command itself. This is a very advanced feature, which most people won't need, but it shows the flexibility provided by migrating all of the previously custom internal logic to be based on the new middleware stack.\nPlugins can now be defined in nested arrays. This is a small addition, but it means that you no longer need to differentiate between individual plugins and multiple plugins in an array. This allows plugins to be more easily composed up from multiple other plugins themselves, without the end user having to change how they use them. Small, but encourages reuse just a little bit more.\nDEPRECATED\nThe slate-simulator is deprecated. Previously this was used as a pseudo-controller for testing purposes. However, now with the new Editor controller as a first-class concept, everything the simulator could do can now be done directly in the library. This should make testing in non-browser environments much easier to do.\nBREAKING\nThe Value object is no longer tied to changes. Previously, you could create a new Change by calling value.change() and retrieve a new value. With the re-architecture to properly decouple the schema, commands, queries and plugins from the core Slate data models, this is no longer possible. Instead, changes are always created via an Editor instance, where those concepts live.\n// Instead of...\nconst { value } = this.state\nconst change = value.change()\n...\nthis.onChange(change)\n\n// You now would do...\nthis.editor.change(change => {\n  const { value } = change\n  ...\n})\n\nSometimes this means you will need to store the React ref of the editor to be able to access its editor.change method in your React components.\nRemove the Stack \"model\", in favor of the new Editor. Previously there was a pseudo-model called the Stack that was very low level, and not really a model. This concept has now been rolled into the new Editor controller, which can be used in any environment because it's just plain JavaScript. There was almost no need to directly use a Stack instance previously, so this change shouldn't affect almost anyone.\nRemove the Schema \"model\", in favor of the new Editor. Previously there was another pseudo-model called the Schema, that was used to contain validation logic. All of the same validation features are still available, but the old Schema model is now rolled into the Editor controller as well, in the form of an internal SchemaPlugin that isn't exposed.\nRemove the schema.isVoid and schema.isAtomic in favor of queries. Previously these two methods were used to query the schema about the behavior of a specific node or decoration. Now these same queries as possible using the \"queries\" concept, and are available directly on the change object:\nif (change.isVoid(node)) {\n  ...\n}\n\nThe middleware stack must now be explicitly continued, using next. Previously returning undefined from a middleware would (usually) continue the stack onto the next middleware. Now, with middleware taking a next function argument you must explicitly decide to continue the stack by call next() yourself.\nRemove the History model, in favor of commands. Previously there was a History model that stored the undo/redo stacks, and managing saving new operations to those stacks. All of this logic has been folded into the new \"commands\" concept, and the undo/redo stacks now live in value.data. This has the benefit of allowing the history behavior to be completely overridable by userland plugins, which was not an easy feat to manage before.\nValues can no longer be normalized on creation. With the decoupling of the data model and the plugin layer, the schema rules are no longer available inside the Value model. This means that you can no longer receive a \"normalized\" value without having access to the Editor and its plugins.\n// While previously you could attach a `schema` to a value...\nconst normalized = Value.create({ ..., schema })\n\n// Now you'd need to do that with the `editor`...\nconst value = Value.create({ ... })\nconst editor = new Editor({ value, plugins: [{ schema }] })\nconst normalized = editor.value\n\nWhile this seems inconvenient, it makes the boundaries in the API much more clear, and keeps the immutable and mutable concepts separated. This specific code sample gets longer, but the complexities elsewhere in the library are removed.\nThe Change class is no longer exported. Changes are now editor-specific, so exporting the Change class no longer makes sense. Instead, you can use the editor.change() API to receive a new change object with the commands and queries specific to your editor's plugins.\nThe getClosestVoid, getDecorations and hasVoidParent method now take an editor. Previously these Node methods took a schema argument, but this has been replaced with the new editor controller instead now that the Schema model has been removed.\n0.41 — September 21, 2018\nDEPRECATED\nThe withoutNormalization helper has been renamed to withoutNormalizing. This is to stay consistent with the new helpers for withoutSaving and withoutMerging.\nBREAKING\nThe the \"operation flags\" concept was removed. This was a confusing concept that was implemented in multiple different ways and led to the logic around normalizing, saving, and merging operations being more complex than it needed to be. These flags have been replaced with three simpler helper functions: withoutNormalizing, withoutSaving and withoutMerging.\nchange.withoutNormalizing(() => {\n  nodes.forEach(node => change.removeNodeByKey(node.key))\n})\n\nchange.withoutSaving(() => {\n  change.setValue({ decorations })\n})\n\nThis means that you no longer use the { normalize: false } or { save: false } options as arguments to individual change methods, and instead use these new helper methods to apply these behaviors to groups of changes at once.\nThe \"normalize\" change methods have been removed. Previously there were a handful of different normalization change methods like normalizeNodeByPath, normalizeParentByKey, etc. These were confusing because it put the onus on the implemented to know exact which nodes needed to be normalized. They have been removed, and implementers no longer ever need to worry about which specific nodes to normalize, as Slate will handle that for them.\nThe internal refindNode and refindPath methods were removed. These should never have been exposed in the first place, and are now no longer present on the Element interface. These were only used internally during the normalization process.\n0.40 — August 22, 2018\nBREAKING\nRemove all previously deprecated code paths. This helps to reduce some of the complexity in Slate by not having to handle these code paths anymore. And it helps to reduce file size. When upgrading, it's highly recommended that you upgrade to the previous version first and ensure there are no deprecation warnings being logged, then upgrade to this version.\n0.39 — August 22, 2018\nNEW\nIntroducing the Range model and interface. Previously the \"range\" concept was used in multiple different places, for the selection, for decorations, and for acting on ranges of the document. This worked okay, but it was hiding the underlying system which is that Range is really an interface that other models can choose to implement. Now, we still use the Range model for referencing parts of the document, but it can also be implemented by other models that need to attach more semantic meaning...\nIntroducing the Decoration and Selection models. These two new models both implement the new Range interface. Where previously they had to mis-use the Range model itself with added semantics. This just cleans up some of the confusion around overlapping properties, and allows us to add even more domain-specific methods and properties in the future without trouble.\nBREAKING\nDecorations have changed! Previously, decorations piggybacked on the Range model, using the existing marks property, and introducing their own isAtomic property. However, they have now been split out into their own Decoration model with a single mark and with the isAtomic property controlled by the schema. What previously would have looked like:\nRange.create({\n  anchor: { ... },\n  focus: { ... },\n  marks: [{ type: 'highlight' }],\n  isAtomic: true,\n})\n\nIs now:\nDecoration.create({\n  anchor: { ... },\n  focus: { ... },\n  mark: { type: 'highlight' },\n})\n\nEach decoration maps to a single mark object. And the atomicity of the mark controlled in the schema instead, for example:\nconst schema = {\n  marks: {\n    highlight: {\n      isAtomic: true,\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nThe Range model has reduced semantics. Previously, since all decorations and selections were ranges, you could create ranges with an isFocused, isAtomic or marks properties. Now Range objects are much simpler, offering only an anchor and a focus, and can be extended by other models implementing the range interface. However, this means that using Range.create or document.createRange might not be what you want anymore. For example, for creating a new selection, you used to use:\nconst selection = document.createRange({\n  isFocused: true,\n  anchor: { ... },\n  focus: { ... },\n})\n\nBut now, you'll need to use document.createSelection instead:\nconst selection = document.createSelection({\n  isFocused: true,\n  anchor: { ... },\n  focus: { ... },\n})\n\nThe value.decorations property is no longer nullable. Previously when no decorations were applied to the value, the decorations property would be set to null. Now it will be an empty List object, so that the interface is more consistent.\nDEPRECATED\nThe Node.createChildren static method is deprecated. This was just an alias for Node.createList and wasn't necessary. You can use Node.createList going forward for the same effect.\nThe renderPortal property of plugins is deprecated. This allows slate-react to be slightly slimmer, since this behavior can be handled in React 16 with the new  using the renderEditor property instead, in a way that offers more control over the portal behavior.\nThe data property of plugins is deprecated. This property wasn't well designed and circumvented the core tenet that all changes to the value object will flow through operations inside Change objects. It was mostly used for view-layer state which should be handled with React-specific conventions for state management instead.\n0.38 — August 21, 2018\nDEPRECATED\nNode.isVoid access is deprecated. Previously the \"voidness\" of a node was hardcoded in the data model. Soon it will be determined at runtime based on your editor's schema. This deprecation just ensures that you aren't using the node.isVoid property which will not work in future verisons. What previously would have been:\nif (node.isVoid) {\n  ...\n}\n\nNow becomes:\nif (schema.isVoid(node)) {\n  ...\n}\n\nThis requires you to have a reference to the schema object, which can be access as value.schema.\nValue.isFocused/isBlurred and Value.hasUndos/hasRedos are deprecated. These properties are easily available via value.selection and value.history instead, and are now deprecated to reduce the complexity and number of different ways of doing things.\n0.37 — August 3, 2018\nNEW\nIntroducing the Point model. Ranges are now built up of two Point models—an anchor and a focus—instead of having the properties set directly on the range itself. This makes the \"point\" concept first-class in Slate and better API's can be built around point objects.\nPoint.create({\n  key: 'a',\n  path: [0, 0],\n  offset: 31,\n})\n\nThese points are exposed on Range objects via the anchor, focus, start and end properties:\nconst { anchor, focus } = range\nchange.removeNodeByKey(anchor.key)\n\nThese replace the earlier anchorKey, anchorOffset, etc. properties.\nDocument.createRange creates a relative range. Previously you'd have to use Range.create and make sure that you passed valid arguments, and ensure that you \"normalized\" the range to sync its keys and paths. This is no longer the case, since the createRange method will do it for you.\nconst range = document.createRange({\n  anchor: {\n    key: 'a',\n    offset: 1,\n  },\n  focus: {\n    key: 'a',\n    offset: 4,\n  },\n})\n\nThis will automatically ensure that the range references leaf text nodes, and that its anchor and focus paths are set.\nDocument.createPoint creates a relative point. Just like the createRange method, createPoint will create a point that is guaranteed to be relative to the document itself. This is often a lot easier than using Point.create directly.\nconst anchor = document.createPoint({\n  key: 'a',\n  offset: 1,\n})\n\nBREAKING\nThe Range.focus method was removed. (Not Change.focus!) This was necessary to make way for the new range.focus point property. Usually this would have been done in a migration-friendly way like the rest of the method changes in this release, but this was an exception. However the change.focus() method is still available and works as expected.\nRange.set and Range.merge are dangerous. If you were previously using the super low-level Immutable.js methods range.set or range.merge with any of the now-removed properties of ranges, these invocations will fail. Instead, you should use the range.set* helpers going forward which can be migrated with deprecations warnings instead of failing outright.\nThe offset property of points defaults to null. Previously it would default to 0 but that could be confusing because it made no distinction from a \"set\" or \"unset\" offset. Now they default to null instead. This shouldn't really affect any real-world usage of Slate.\nThe Range.toJSON() structure has changed. With the introduction of points, the range now returns its anchor and focus properties as nested point JSON objects instead of directly as properties. For example:\n{\n  \"object\": \"range\",\n  \"anchor\": {\n    \"object\": \"point\",\n    \"key\": \"a\",\n    \"offset\": 1,\n    \"path\": [0, 0]\n  },\n  \"focus\": {\n    \"object\": \"point\",\n    \"key\": \"a\",\n    \"offset\": 3,\n    \"path\": [0, 0]\n  },\n  \"isAtomic\": false,\n  \"isFocused\": false,\n  \"marks\": []\n}\n\nDEPRECATED\nThe selection-based shorts on Value were deprecated. Previously you could access things like anchorKey, startOffset and isCollapsed directly on Value objects. This results in extra duplication that is hard to maintain over time, and hard for newcomers to understand, without much benefit. All of these properties are deprecated and should be accessed on the value.selection object directly instead.\nThe Range methods were standardized, with many deprecated. The methods on Range objects had grown drastically in size. Many of them weren't consistently named, or overlapped in unnecessary ways. With the introduction of Point objects a lot of these methods could be cleaned up and their logic delegated to the points directly. All of these methods remain available but will raise deprecation warnings, making it easier to upgrade.\nThere's a very good chance you're only using a handful of them in your codebase. Either way, all of them will log warnings. For an example of migrating see this commit.\nHere's a full list of the newly deprecated methods and properties, and their new alternative if one exists:\nanchorKey -> anchor.key\nanchorOffset -> anchor.offset\nanchorPath -> anchor.path\nblur -> setIsFocused\ncollapseTo -> moveTo\ncollapseToAnchor -> moveToAnchor\ncollapseToEnd -> moveToEnd\ncollapseToEndOf -> moveToEndOfNode\ncollapseToFocus -> moveToFocus\ncollapseToStart -> moveToStart\ncollapseToStartOf -> moveToStartOfNode\ndeselect -> Range.create\nendKey -> end.key\nendOffset -> end.offset\nendPath -> end.path\nextend -> moveFocus\nextendTo -> moveFocusTo\nextendToEndOf -> moveFocusToEndOfNode\nextendToStartOf -> moveFocusToStartOfNode\nfocusKey -> focus.key\nfocusOffset -> focus.offset\nfocusPath -> focus.path\nhasAnchorAtEndOf -> anchor.isAtEndOfNode\nhasAnchorAtStartOf -> anchor.isAtStartOfNode\nhasAnchorBetween ->\nhasAnchorIn -> anchor.isInNode\nhasEdgeAtEndOf -> anchor.isAtEndOfNode || focus.isAtEndOfNode\nhasEdgeAtStartOf -> anchor.isAtStartOfNode || focus.isAtStartOfNode\nhasEdgeBetween ->\nhasEdgeIn -> anchor.isInNode || focus.isInNode\nhasEndAtEndOf -> end.isAtEndOfNode\nhasEndAtStartOf -> end.isAtEndOfNode\nhasEndBetween ->\nhasEndIn -> end.isInNode\nhasFocusAtEndOf -> focus.isAtEndOfNode\nhasFocusAtStartOf -> focus.isAtStartOfNode\nhasFocusBetween ->\nhasFocusIn -> focus.isInNode\nhasStartAtEndOf -> start.isAtEndOfNode\nhasStartAtStartOf -> start.isAtStartOfNode\nhasStartBetween ->\nhasStartIn -> start.isInNode\nisAtEndOf -> isCollapsed && anchor.isAtEndOfNode\nisAtStartOf -> isCollapsed && anchor.isAtStartOfNode\nmove -> moveForward/Backward\nmoveAnchor -> moveAnchorForward/Backward\nmoveAnchorOffsetTo -> moveAnchorTo\nmoveAnchorOffsetTo -> moveAnchorTo\nmoveAnchorToEndOf -> moveAnchorToEndOfNode\nmoveAnchorToStartOf -> moveAnchorToStartOfNode\nmoveEnd -> moveEndForward/Backward\nmoveEndOffsetTo -> moveEndTo\nmoveFocus -> moveFocusForward/Backward\nmoveFocusOffsetTo -> moveFocusTo\nmoveFocusOffsetTo -> moveFocusTo\nmoveFocusToEndOf -> moveFocusToEndOfNode\nmoveFocusToStartOf -> moveFocusToStartOfNode\nmoveOffsetsTo -> moveAnchorTo && moveFocusTo\nmoveStart -> moveStartForward/Backward\nmoveStartOffsetTo -> moveStartTo\nmoveToEndOf -> moveToEndOfNode\nmoveToRangeOf -> moveToRangeOfNode\nmoveToStartOf -> moveToStartOfNode\nstartKey -> start.key\nstartOffset -> start.offset\nstartPath -> start.path\n\nThe selection-based changes were standardized, with many deprecated. Similarly to the Range method deprecations, the same confusion and poor naming choices existed in the Change methods that dealt with selections. Many of them have been renamed for consistency, or deprecated when alternatives existed. All of these methods remain available but will raise deprecation warnings, making it easier to upgrade.\nThere's a very good chance you're only using a handful of these change methods in your codebase. Either way, all of them will log warnings. For an example of migrating see this commit.\nHere's a full list of the newly deprecated changed methods, and their new alternative if one exists:\ncollapseCharBackward -> moveBackward\ncollapseCharForward -> moveForward\ncollapseLineBackward -> moveToStartOfBlock\ncollapseLineForward -> moveToEndOfBlock\ncollapseTo -> moveTo\ncollapseToAnchor -> moveToAnchor\ncollapseToEnd -> moveToEnd\ncollapseToEndOf -> moveToEndOfNode\ncollapseToEndOfBlock -> moveToEndOfBlock\ncollapseToEndOfNextBlock -> moveToEndOfNextBlock\ncollapseToEndOfNextText -> moveToEndOfNextText\ncollapseToEndOfPreviousBlock -> moveToEndOfPreviousBlock\ncollapseToEndOfPreviousText -> moveToEndOfPreviousText\ncollapseToFocus -> moveToFocus\ncollapseToStart -> moveToStart\ncollapseToStartOf -> moveToStartOfNode\ncollapseToStartOfBlock -> moveToStartOfBlock\ncollapseToStartOfNextBlock -> moveToStartOfNextBlock\ncollapseToStartOfNextText -> moveToStartOfNextText\ncollapseToStartOfPreviousBlock -> moveToStartOfPreviousBlock\ncollapseToStartOfPreviousText -> moveToStartOfPreviousText\nextend -> moveFocusForward/Backward\nextendCharBackward -> moveFocusBackward\nextendCharForward -> moveFocusForward\nextendLineBackward -> moveFocusToStartOfBlock\nextendLineForward -> moveFocusToEndOfBlock\nextendTo -> moveFocusTo\nextendToEndOf -> moveFocusToEndOfNode\nextendToEndOfBlock -> moveFocusToEndOfBlock\nextendToEndOfNextBlock -> moveFocusToEndOfNextBlock\nextendToEndOfNextInline -> moveFocusToEndOfNextInline\nextendToEndOfNextText -> moveFocusToEndOfNextText\nextendToEndOfPreviousBlock -> moveFocusToEndOfPreviousBlock\nextendToEndOfPreviousInline -> moveFocusToEndOfPreviousInline\nextendToEndOfPreviousText -> moveFocusToEndOfPreviousText\nextendToStartOf -> moveFocusToStartOfNode\nextendToStartOfBlock -> moveFocusToStartOfBlock\nextendToStartOfNextBlock -> moveFocusToStartOfNextBlock\nextendToStartOfNextInline -> moveFocusToStartOfNextInline\nextendToStartOfNextText -> moveFocusToStartOfNextText\nextendToStartOfPreviousBlock -> moveFocusToStartOfPreviousBlock\nextendToStartOfPreviousInline -> moveFocusToStartOfPreviousInline\nextendToStartOfPreviousText -> moveFocusToStartOfPreviousText\nmove -> moveForward/Backward\nmoveAnchor -> moveAnchorForward/Backward\nmoveAnchorCharBackward -> moveAnchorBackward\nmoveAnchorCharForward -> moveAnchorForward\nmoveAnchorOffsetTo -> moveAnchorTo\nmoveAnchorToEndOf -> moveAnchorToEndOfNode\nmoveAnchorToStartOf -> moveAnchorToEndOfNode\nmoveCharBackward -> moveBackward\nmoveCharForward -> moveForward\nmoveEnd -> moveEndForward/Backward\nmoveEndCharBackward -> moveEndBackward\nmoveEndCharForward -> moveEndForward\nmoveEndOffsetTo -> moveEndTo\nmoveFocus -> moveFocusForward/Backward\nmoveFocusCharBackward -> moveFocusBackward\nmoveFocusCharForward -> moveFocusForward\nmoveFocusOffsetTo -> moveFocusTo\nmoveFocusToEndOf -> moveFocusToEndOfNode\nmoveFocusToStartOf -> moveFocusToEndOfNode\nmoveOffsetsTo -> moveAnchorTo/moveFocusTo\nmoveStart -> moveStartForward/Backward\nmoveStartCharBackward -> moveStartBackward\nmoveStartCharForward -> moveStartForward\nmoveStartOffsetTo -> moveStartTo\nmoveToEndOf -> moveToEndOfNode\nmoveToRangeOf -> moveToRangeOfNode\nmoveToStartOf -> moveToStartOfNode\nselectAll -> moveToRangeOfDocument\n\n0.36 — July 27, 2018\nBREAKING\nSchema rules have changed! To make them able to be used in more cases (so you don't have to dip down to the slower validateNode/normalizeNode function), the matching syntax for schema rules has changed. Previously multiples types/objects would be expressed as:\n{\n  parent: { types: ['ordered_list', 'unordered_list'] },\n}\n\nNow there is a new match object concept, which looks like:\n{\n  parent: { object: 'block', type: 'list' },\n}\n\nMatch objects can be objects, or an array of objects which acts as OR:\n{\n  parent: [{ type: 'ordered_list' }, { type: 'unordered_list' }],\n}\n\nAdditionally, schema rules can now be defined using a schema.rules array of objects with top-level match properties. This allows for matching nodes in ways that were previously impossible. For example:\n{\n  schema: {\n    rules: [{\n      // Match all blocks, regardless of type!\n      match: { object: 'block' },\n      text: /.../g,\n      normalize: () => { ... },\n    }]\n  }\n}\n\nAll of the shorthands like schema.blocks and schema.inlines are still available, and are simply rewritten to the more flexible rules syntax under the covers. These changes are just a small way of making Slate more flexible for advanced use cases when you run into them.\nSchema rule normalize functions now receive SlateError objects. Previously they would be called with a signature of (change, violation, context). They are now called with (change, error). This new error is a SlateError object with an error.code and all of the same context properties.\nA normalizer that previously looked like:\n{\n  normalize: (change, violation, context) {\n    if (violation === 'child_type_invalid') {\n      const type = index === 0 ? 'title' : 'paragraph'\n      return change.setNodeByKey(context.child.key, type)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWould now look like:\n{\n  normalize: (change, error) {\n    if (error.code === 'child_type_invalid') {\n      const type = index === 0 ? 'title' : 'paragraph'\n      return change.setNodeByKey(error.child.key, type)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis is just an attempt to make dealing with normalization errors slightly more idiomatic with how errors are represented in most libraries, in order to not reinvent the wheel unnecessarily.\n0.35 — July 27, 2018\nNEW\nRange objects now keep track of paths, in addition to keys. Previously ranges only stored their points as keys. Now both paths and keys are used, which allows you to choose which one is the most convenient or most performant for your use case. They are kept in sync my Slate under the covers.\nA new set of *ByPath change methods have been added. All of the changes you could previously do with a *ByKey change are now also supported with a *ByPath change of the same name. The path-based changes are often more performant than the key-based ones.\nPaths are now of type List instead of array. See the documentation of List for its differences to array (get method instead of array indexing, size instead of length, etc).\nBREAKING\nInternal-yet-public Node methods have been changed. There were a handful of internal methods that shouldn't be used in 99% of Slate implementations that updated or removed. This was done in the process of streamlining many of the Node methods to make them more consistent and easier to use. For a list of those affected:\n\nNode.assertPath was changed. It was previously confusingly named because the equivalent Node.getPath did something completely different. You should now use Node.assertNode(path) if you need this behavior.\nNode.removeDescendant was removed. There's no reason you should have been using this, since it was an undocumented and unused method that was left over from a previous version.\nNode.updateNode, Node.insertNode, Node.removeNode, Node.splitNode and Node.mergeNode mutating methods were changed. All of your changes should be done with operations, so you likely weren't using these internal methods. They have been changed internally to use paths.\n\nDEPRECATED\nThe setKeyGenerator and resetKeyGenerator helpers are deprecated. These were previously used to change the default key generation logic. Now you can use the equivalent KeyUtils.setGenerator and KeyUtils.resetGenerator helpers instead. This follows the new pattern of grouping related utilities into single namespaces, as is the case with the new PathUtils and TextUtils.\nInternal-yet-public Node methods have been deprecated. There were a handful of internal methods that shouldn't be used in 99% of Slate implementations that were deprecated. For a list of those affected:\n\nNode.getKeys and Node.getKeysAsArray were deprecated. If you really need to check the presence of a key, use the new Node.getKeysToPathsObject instead.\nNode.areDescendantsSorted and Node.isInRange were deprecated. These were used to check whether a node was in a range, but this can be done more performantly and more easily with paths now.\nNode.getNodeAtPath and Node.getDescendantAtPath were deprecated. These were probably not in use by anyone, but if you were using them you can use the existing Node.getNode and Node.getDescendant methods instead which now take either paths or keys.\n\n0.34 — June 14, 2018\nNEW\nDecorations can now be \"atomic\". If you set a decoration as atomic, it will be removed when changed, preventing it from entering a \"partial\" state, which can be useful for some use cases.\nBREAKING\nText nodes now represent their content as \"leaves\". Previously their immutable representation used individual Character instance for each character. Now they have changed to group characters into Leaf models, which more closely resembles how they are used, and results in a lot fewer immutable object instances floating around. For most people this shouldn't cause any issues, since this is a low-level aspect of Slate.\nDEPRECATED\nThe Character model is deprecated. Although the character concept is still in the repository for now, it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Everything it solves can be solved with leaves instead.\n0.33 — February 21, 2018\nBREAKING\nVoid nodes no longer prescribe their text content. Previously void nodes would automatically normalize their text content to be a single text node containing ' ' an empty string of content. This restriction was removed, so that void nodes can have arbitrary content. You can use this to store information in void nodes in a way that is more consistent with non-void nodes.\nDEPRECATED\nThe setBlock method has been renamed to setBlocks. This is to make it more clear that it operates on any of the current blocks in the selection, not just a single blocks.\nThe setInline method has been renamed to setInlines. For the same reason as setBlocks, to be clear and stay consistent.\n0.32 — January 4, 2018\nBREAKING\nThe kind property of Slate objects has been renamed to object. This is to reduce the confusion over the difference between \"kind\" and \"type\" which are practically synonyms. The \"object\" name was chosen to match the Stripe API, since it seems like a sensible choice and reads much more nicely when looking through JSON.\nAll normalization reasons containing kind have been renamed too. Previously there were normalization reason strings like child_kind_invalid. These types of strings have been renamed to child_object_invalid to stay consistent.\n0.31 — November 16, 2017\nNEW\nAdded a new Operation model. This model is used to store operations for the history stack, and (de)serializes them in a consistent way for collaborative editing use cases.\nBREAKING\nOperation objects in Slate are now immutable records. Previously they were native, mutable JavaScript objects. Now, there's a new immutable Operation model in Slate, ensuring that all of the data inside Value objects are immutable. And it allows for easy serialization of operations using operation.toJSON() for when sending them between editors. This should not affect most users, unless you are relying on changing the values of the low-level Slate operations (simply reading them is fine).\nOperation lists in Slate are now immutable lists. Previously they were native, mutable JavaScript arrays. Now, to keep consistent with other immutable uses, they are immutable lists. This should not affect most users.\n0.30 — October 27, 2017\nBREAKING\nRemove all previously deprecated code paths. This helps to reduce some of the complexity in Slate by not having to handle these code paths anymore. And it helps to reduce file size. When upgrading, it's highly recommended that you upgrade to the previous version first and ensure there are no deprecation warnings being logged, then upgrade to this version.\n0.29 — October 27, 2017\nNEW\nAdded the new Value model to replace State. The new model is exactly the same, but with a new name. There is also a shimmed State model exported that warns when used, to ease migration.\nBREAKING\nThe set_state operation has been renamed set_value. This shouldn't affect almost anyone, but in the event that you were relying on the low-level operation types you'll need to update this.\nDEPRECATED\nThe \"state\" has been renamed to \"value\" everywhere. All of the current references are maintained as deprecations, so you should be able to upgrade and see warnings logged instead of being greeted with a broken editor. This is to reduce the confusion between React's \"state\" and Slate's editor value, and in an effort to further mimic the native DOM APIs.\n0.28 — October 25, 2017\nNEW\nState objects now have an embedded state.schema property. This new schema property is used to automatically normalize the state as it changes, according to the editor's current schema. This makes normalization much easier.\nBREAKING\nThe Schema objects in Slate have changed! Previously, they used to be where you could define normalization rules, define rendering rules, and define decoration rules. This was overloaded, and made other improvements hard. Now, rendering and decorating is done via the newly added plugin functions (renderNode, renderMark, decorateNode). And validation is done either via the lower-level validateNode plugin function, or via the new schema objects.\nThe normalize* change methods no longer take a schema argument. Previously you had to maintain a reference to your schema, and pass it into the normalize methods when you called them. Since State objects now have an embedded state.schema property, this is no longer needed.\n0.27 — October 14, 2017\nBREAKING\nThe Range model is now called Leaf. This is to disambiguate with the concept of \"ranges\" that is used throughout the codebase to be synonymous to selections. For example in methods like getBlocksAtRange(selection).\nThe text.ranges property in the JSON representation is now text.leaves. When passing in JSON with text.ranges you'll now receive a deprecation warning in the console in development.\nDEPRECATED\nThe Selection model is now called Range. This is to make it more clear what a \"selection\" really is, to make many of the other methods that act on \"ranges\" make sense, and to more closely parallel the native DOM API for selections and ranges. A mock Selection object is still exported with deprecated static methods, to make the transition to the new API easier.\nThe Text.getRanges() method is now Text.getLeaves(). It will still work, and it will return a list of leaves, but you will see a deprecation warning in the console in development.\n0.26 — October 13, 2017\nBREAKING\nThe decorate function of schema rules has changed. Previously, in decorate you would receive a text node and the matched node, and you'd need to manually add any marks you wanted to the text node's characters. Now, \"decorations\" have changed to just be Selection objects with marks in the selection.marks property. Instead of applying the marks yourself, you simply return selection ranges with the marks to be applied, and Slate will apply them internally. This makes it possible to write much more complex decoration behaviors. Check out the revamped code-highlighting example and the new search-highlighting example to see this in action.\nThe set_data operation type has been replaced by set_state. With the new state.decorations property, it doesn't make sense to have a new operation type for every property of State objects. Instead, the new set_state operation more closely mimics the existing set_mark and set_node operations.\nDEPRECATED\nNEW\nYou can now set decorations based on external information. Previously, the \"decoration\" logic in Slate was always based off of the text of a node, and would only re-render when that text changed. Now, there is a new state.decorations property that you can set via change.setState({ decorations }). You can use this to add presentation-only marks to arbitrary ranges of text in the document. Check out the new search-highlighting example to see this in action.\nThe setData change method has been replaced by setState. Previously you would call change.setData(data). But as new State properties are introduced it doesn't make sense to need to add new change methods each time. Instead, the new change.setState(properties) more closesely mimics the existing setMarkByKey and setNodeByKey. To achieve the old behavior, you can do change.setState({ data }).\nThe preserveStateData option of state.toJSON has changed. The same behavior is now called preserveData instead. This makes it consistent with all of the existing options, and the new preserveDecorations option as well.\n0.25 — September 21, 2017\nBREAKING\nThe insertBlock change method no longer replaces empty blocks. Previously if you used insertBlock and the selection was in an empty block, it would replace it. Now you'll need to perform that check yourself and use the new replaceNodeByKey method instead.\nThe Block.create and Inline.create methods no longer normalize. Previously if you used one of them to create a block or inline with zero nodes in it, they would automatically add a single empty text node as the only child. This was unexpected in certain situations, and if you were relying on this you'll need to handle it manually instead now.\n0.24 — September 11, 2017\nNEW\nSlate is now a \"monorepo\". Instead of a single package, Slate has been divided up into individual packages so that you can only require what you need, cutting down on file size. In the process, some helpful modules that used to be internal-only are now exposed.\nThere's a new slate-hyperscript helper. This was possible thanks to the work on slate-sugar, which paved the way.\nThe slate-prop-types package is now exposed. Previously this was an internal module, but now you can use it for adding prop types to any components or plugins you create.\nThe slate-simulator package is now exposed. Previously this was an internal testing utility, but now you can use it in your own tests as well. It's currently pretty bare bones, but we can add to it over time.\nBREAKING\nimmutable is now a peer dependency of Slate. Previously it was a regular dependency, but this prevented you from bringing your own version, or you'd have duplication. You'll need to ensure you install it!\nThe Html, Plain and Raw serializers are broken into new packages. Previously you'd import them from slate. But now you'll import them from slate-html-serializer and slate-plain-serializer. And the Raw serializer that was deprecated is now removed.\nThe Editor and Placeholder components are broken into a new React-specific package. Previously you'd import them from slate. But now you import { Editor } from 'slate-react' instead.\n0.23 — September 10, 2017\nNEW\nSlate models now have Model.fromJSON(object) and model.toJSON() methods. These methods operate with the canonical JSON form (which used to be called \"raw\"). This way you don't need to import a serializer to retrieve JSON, if you have the model you can serialize/deserialize.\nModels also have toJS and fromJS aliases. This is just to match Immutable.js objects, which have both methods. For Slate though, the methods are equivalent.\nBREAKING\nThe isNative property of State has been removed. Previously this was used for performance reasons to avoid re-rendering, but it is no longer needed. This shouldn't really affect most people because it's rare that you'd be relying on this property to exist.\nDEPRECATED\nThe Raw serializer is now deprecated. The entire \"raw\" concept is being removed, in favor of allowing all models to be able to serialize and deserialize to JSON themselves. Instead of using the Raw serializer, you can now use the fromJSON and toJSON on the models directly.\nThe toRaw options for the Plain and Html serializers are now called toJSON. This is to stay symmetrical with the removal of the \"raw\" concept everywhere.\nThe terse option for JSON serialization has been deprecated! This option causes lots of abstraction leakiness because it means there is no one canonical JSON representation of objects. You had to work with either terse or not terse data.\nThe Html serializer no longer uses the terse representation. This shouldn't actually be an issue for anyone because the main manifestation of this has a deprecation notice with a patch in place for now.\nThe defaultBlockType of the Html serializer is now called defaultBlock. This is just to make it more clear that it supports not only setting the default type but also data and isVoid.\n0.22 — September 5, 2017\nNEW\nThe state.activeMarks returns the intersection of marks in the selection. Previously there was only state.marks which returns marks that appeared on any character in the selection. But state.activeMarks returns marks that appear on every character in the selection, which is often more useful for implementing standard richtext editor behaviors.\nBREAKING\nThe Plain serializer now adds line breaks between blocks. Previously between blocks the text would be joined without any space whatsoever, but this wasn't really that useful or what you'd expect.\nThe toggleMark transform now checks the intersection of marks. Previously, toggling would remove the mark from the range if any of the characters in a range didn't have it. However, this wasn't what all other richtext editors did, so the behavior has changed to mimic the standard behavior. Now, if any characters in the selection have the mark applied, it will first be added when toggling.\nThe .length property of nodes has been removed. This property caused issues with code like in Lodash that checked for \"array-likeness\" by simply looking for a .length property that was a number.\nonChange now receives a Change object (previously named Transform) instead of a State. This is needed because it enforces that all changes are represented by a single set of operations. Otherwise right now it's possible to do things like state.transform()....apply({ save: false }).transform()....apply() and result in losing the operation information in the history. With OT, we need all transforms that may happen to be exposed and emitted by the editor. The new syntax looks like:\nonChange(change) {\n  this.setState({ state: change.state })\n}\n\nonChange({ state }) {\n  this.setState({ state })\n}\n\nSimilarly, handlers now receive e, data, change instead of e, data, state. Instead of doing return state.transform()....apply() the plugins can now act on the change object directly. Plugins can still return change... if they want to break the stack from continuing on to other plugins. (Any != null value will break out.) But they can also now not return anything, and the stack will apply their changes and continue onwards. This was previously impossible. The new syntax looks like:\nfunction onKeyDown(e, data, change) {\n  if (data.key == 'enter') {\n    return change.splitBlock()\n  }\n}\n\nThe onChange and on[Before]Change handlers now receive Change objects. Previously they would also receive a state object, but now they receive change objects like the rest of the plugin API.\nThe .apply({ save }) option is now state.change({ save }) instead. This is the easiest way to use it, but requires that you know whether to save or not up front. If you want to use it inline after already saving some changes, you can use the change.setOperationFlag('save', true) flag instead. This shouldn't be necessary for 99% of use cases though.\nThe .undo() and .redo() transforms don't save by default. Previously you had to specifically tell these transforms not to save into the history, which was awkward. Now they won't save the operations they're undoing/redoing by default.\nonBeforeChange is no longer called from componentWillReceiveProps, when a new state is passed in as props to the  component. This caused lots of state-management issues and was weird in the first place because passing in props would result in changes firing. It is now the parent component's responsibility to not pass in improperly formatted State objects.\nThe splitNodeByKey change method has changed to be shallow. Previously, it would deeply split to an offset. But now it is shallow and another splitDescendantsByKey change method has been added (with a different signature) for the deep splitting behavior. This is needed because splitting and joining operations have been changed to all be shallow, which is required so that operational transforms can be written against them.\nBlocks cannot have mixed \"inline\" and \"block\" children anymore. Blocks were implicitly expected to either contain \"text\" and \"inline\" nodes only, or to contain \"block\" nodes only. Invalid case are now normalized by the core schema.\nThe shape of many operations has changed. This was needed to make operations completely invertible without any extra context. The operations were never really exposed in a consumable way, so I won't detail all of the changes here, but feel free to look at the source to see the details.\nAll references to \"joining\" nodes is now called \"merging\". This is to be slightly clearer, since merging can only happen with adjacent nodes already, and to have a nicer parallel with \"splitting\", as in cells. The operation is now called merge_node, and the transforms are now merge*.\nDEPRECATED\nThe transform.apply() method is deprecated. Previously this is where the saving into the history would happen, but it created an awkward convention that wasn't necessary. Now operations are saved into the history as they are created with change methods, instead of waiting until the end. You can access the new State of a change at any time via change.state.\n0.21 — July 20, 2017\nBREAKING\nThe Html serializer now uses DOMParser instead of cheerio. Previously, the Html serializer used the cheerio library for representing elements in the serialization rule logic, but cheerio was a very large dependency. It has been removed, and the native browser DOMParser is now used instead. All HTML serialization rules will need to be updated. If you are working with Slate on the server, you can now pass in a custom serializer to the Html constructor, using the parse5 library.\n0.20 — May 17, 2017\nBREAKING\nReturning null from the Html serializer skips the element. Previously, null and undefined had the same behavior of skipping the rule and trying the rest of the rules. Now if you explicitly return null it will skip the element itself.\n0.19 — March 3, 2017\nBREAKING\nThe filterDescendants and findDescendants methods are now depth-first. This shouldn't affect almost anyone, since they are usually not the best things to be using for performance reasons. If you happen to have a very specific use case that needs breadth-first, (or even likely something better), you'll need to implement it yourself.\nDEPRECATED\nSome Node methods have been deprecated! There were a few methods that had been added over time that were either poorly named that have been deprecated and renamed, and a handful of methods that are no longer useful for the core library that have been deprecated. Here's a full list:\n\nareDescendantSorted -> areDescendantsSorted\ngetHighestChild -> getFurthestAncestor\ngetHighestOnlyChildParent -> getFurthestOnlyChildAncestor\nconcatChildren\ndecorateTexts\nfilterDescendantsDeep\nfindDescendantDeep\ngetChildrenBetween\ngetChildrenBetweenIncluding\nisInlineSplitAtRange\n\n0.18 — March 2, 2017\nBREAKING\nThe plugin.render property is now called plugin.renderPortal. This is to make way for the new plugin.render property that offers HOC-like behavior, so that plugins can augment the editor however they choose.\n0.17 — February 27, 2017\nDEPRECATED\nSome Selection methods have been deprecated! Previously there were many inconsistencies in the naming and handling of selection changes. This has all been cleaned up, but in the process some methods have been deprecated. Here is a full list of the deprecated methods and their new alternatives:\n\nmoveToOffsets -> moveOffsetsTo\nmoveForward -> move\nmoveBackward -> move\nmoveAnchorOffset -> moveAnchor\nmoveFocusOffset -> moveFocus\nmoveStartOffset -> moveStart\nmoveEndOffset -> moveEnd\nextendForward -> extend\nextendBackward -> extend\nunset -> deselect\n\nSome selection transforms have been deprecated! Along with the methods, the selection-based transforms have also been refactored, resulting in deprecations. Here is a full list of the deprecated transforms and their new alternatives:\n\nmoveTo -> select\nmoveToOffsets -> moveOffsetsTo\nmoveForward -> move\nmoveBackward -> move\nmoveStartOffset -> moveStart\nmoveEndOffset -> moveEnd\nextendForward -> extend\nextendBackward -> extend\nflipSelection -> flip\nunsetSelection -> deselect\nunsetMarks\n\n0.16 — December 2, 2016\nBREAKING\nInline nodes are now always surrounded by text nodes. Previously this behavior only occured for inline nodes with isVoid: true. Now, all inline nodes will always be surrounded by text nodes. If text nodes don't exist, empty ones will be created. This allows for more consistent behavior across Slate, and parity with other editing experiences.\n0.15 — November 17, 2016\nBREAKING\nThe unique key generated values have changed. Previously, Slate generated unique keys that looked like '9dk3'. But they were not very conflict-resistant. Now the keys are simple string of auto-incrementing numbers, like '0', '1', '2'. This makes more clear that keys are simply a convenient way to uniquely reference nodes in the short-term lifespan of a single in-memory instance of Slate. They are not designed to be used for long-term uniqueness. A new setKeyGenerator function has been exported that allows you to pass in your own key generating mechanism if you want to ensure uniqueness.\nThe Raw serializer doesn't preserve keys by default. Previously, the Raw serializer would omit keys when passed the terse: true option, but preserve them without it. Now it will always omit keys, unless you pass the new preserveKeys: true option. This better reflects that keys are temporary, in-memory IDs.\nOperations on the document now update the selection when needed. This won't affect you unless you were doing some very specific things with transforms and updating selections. Overall, this makes it much easier to write transforms, since in most cases, the underlying operations will update the selection as you would expect without you doing anything.\nDEPRECATED\nNode accessor methods no longer accept being passed another node! Previously, node accessor methods like node.getParent could be passed either a key string or a node object. For performance reasons, passing in a node object is being deprecated. So if you have any calls that look like: node.getParent(descendant), they will now need to be written as node.getParent(descendant.key). They will throw a warning for now, and will throw an error in a later version of Slate.\n0.14 — September 10, 2016\nBREAKING\nThe undo and redo transforms need to be applied! Previously, undo and redo were special cased such that they did not require an .apply() call, and instead would return a new State directly. Now this is no longer the case, and they are just like every other transform.\nTransforms are no longer exposed on State or Node. The transforms API has been completely refactored to be built up of \"operations\" for collaborative editing support. As part of this refactor, the transforms are now only available via the state.transform() API, and aren't exposed on the State or Node objects as they were before.\nTransform objects are now mutable. Previously Transform was an Immutable.js Record, but now it is a simple constructor. This is because transforms are inherently mutating their representation of a state, but this decision is up for discussion.\nThe selection can now be \"unset\". Previously, a selection could never be in an \"unset\" state where the anchorKey or focusKey was null. This is no longer technically true, although this shouldn't really affect anyone in practice.\n0.13 — August 15, 2016\nBREAKING\nThe renderNode and renderMark properties are gone! Previously, rendering nodes and marks happened via these two properties of the , but this has been replaced by the new schema property. Check out the updated examples to see how to define a schema! There's a good chance this eliminates extra code for most use cases! :smile:\nThe renderDecorations property is gone! Decoration rendering has also been replaced by the new schema property of the .\n0.12 — August 9, 2016\nBREAKING\nThe data.files property is now an Array. Previously it was a native FileList object, but needed to be changed to add full support for pasting an dropping files in all browsers. This shouldn't affect you unless you were specifically depending on it being array-like instead of a true Array.\n0.11 — August 4, 2016\nBREAKING\nVoid nodes are renderered implicitly again! Previously Slate had required that you wrap void node renderers yourself with the exposed  wrapping component. This was to allow for selection styling, but a change was made to make selection styling able to handled in JavaScript. Now the  wrapper will be implicitly rendered by Slate, so you do not need to worry about it, and \"voidness\" only needs to toggled in one place, the isVoid: true property of a node.\n0.10 — July 29, 2016\nBREAKING\nMarks are now renderable as components. Previously the only supported way to render marks was by returning a style object. Now you can return a style object, a class name string, or a full React component. Because of this, the DOM will be renderered slightly differently than before, resulting in an extra  when rendering non-component marks. This won't affect you unless you were depending on the DOM output by Slate for some reason.\n0.9 — July 28, 2016\nBREAKING\nThe wrap and unwrap method signatures have changed! Previously, you would pass type and data as separate parameters, for example: wrapBlock('code', { src: true }). This was inconsistent with other transforms, and has been updated such that a single argument of properties is passed instead. So that example could now be: wrapBlock({ type: 'code', { data: { src: true }}). You can still pass a type string as shorthand, which will be the most frequent use case, for example: wrapBlock('code').\n0.8 — July 27, 2016\nBREAKING\nThe onKeyDown and onBeforeInput handlers signatures have changed! Previously, some Slate handlers had a signature of (e, state, editor) and others had a signature of (e, data, state, editor). Now all handlers will be passed a data object—which contains Slate-specific data related to the event—even if it is empty. This is helpful for future compatibility where we might need to add data to a handler that previously didn't have any, and is nicer for consistency. The onKeyDown handler's new data object contains the key name, code and a series of is* properties to make working with hotkeys easier. The onBeforeInput handler's new data object is empty.\nThe Utils export has been removed. Previously, a Key utility and the findDOMNode utility were exposed under the Utils object. The Key has been removed in favor of the data object passed to onKeyDown. And then findDOMNode utility has been upgraded to a top-level named export, so you'll now need to access it via import { findDOMNode } from 'slate'.\nVoid nodes now permanently have \" \" as content. Previously, they contained an empty string, but this isn't technically correct, since they have content and shouldn't be considered \"empty\". Now they will have a single space of content. This shouldn't really affect anyone, unless you happened to be accessing that string for serialization.\nEmpty inline nodes are now impossible. This is to stay consistent with native contenteditable behavior, where although technically the elements can exist, they have odd behavior and can never be selected.\n0.7 — July 24, 2016\nBREAKING\nThe Raw serializer is no longer terse by default! Previously, the Raw serializer would return a \"terse\" representation of the document, omitting information that wasn't strictly necessary to deserialize later, like the key of nodes. By default this no longer happens. You have to opt-in to the behavior by passing { terse: true } as the second options argument of the deserialize and serialize methods.\n0.6 — July 22, 2016\nBREAKING\nVoid components are no longer rendered implicity! Previously, Slate would automatically wrap any node with isVoid: true in a  component. But doing this prevented you from customizing the wrapper, like adding a className or style property. So you must now render the wrapper yourself, and it has been exported as Slate.Void. This, combined with a small change to the  component's structure allows the \"selected\" state of void nodes to be rendered purely with CSS based on the :focus property of a  element, which previously had to be handled in JavaScript. This allows us to streamline selection-handling logic, improving performance and reducing complexity.\ndata-offset-key is now - instead of :-. This shouldn't actually affect anyone, unless you were specifically relying on that attribute in the DOM. This change greatly reduces the number of re-renders needed, since previously any additional characters would cause a cascading change in the  and  offsets of latter text ranges.\n0.5 — July 20, 2016\nBREAKING\nnode.getTextNodes() is now node.getTexts(). This is just for consistency with the other existing Node methods like getBlocks(), getInlines(), etc. And it's nicely shorter. :wink:\nNode methods now throw earlier during unexpected states. This shouldn't break anything for most folks, unless a strange edge-case was going undetected previously.\n0.4 — July 20, 2016\nBREAKING\nrenderMark(mark, state, editor) is now renderMark(mark, marks, state, editor). This change allows you to render marks based on multiple marks presence at once on a given range of text, for example using a custom BoldItalic.otf font when text has both bold and italic marks.\n0.3 — July 20, 2016\nBREAKING\ntransform.unwrapBlock() now unwraps selectively. Previously, calling unwrapBlock with a range representing a middle sibling would unwrap all of the siblings, removing the wrapping block entirely. Now, calling it with those same arguments will only move the middle sibling up a layer in the hierarchy, preserving the nesting on any of its siblings. This changes makes it much simpler to implement functionality like unwrapping a single list item, which previously would unwrap the entire list.\n0.2 — July 18, 2016\nBREAKING\ntransform.mark() is now transform.addMark() and transform.unmark() is now transform.removeMark(). The new names make it clearer that the transforms are actions being performed, and it paves the way for adding a toggleMark convenience as well.\n0.1 — July 13, 2016\n:tada:\n"},"general/faq.html":{"url":"general/faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nA series of common questions people have about Slate:\n\nWhy is content pasted as plain text?\nWhat browsers and devices does Slate support?\n\nWhy is content pasted as plain text?\nOne of Slate's core principles is that, unlike most other editors, it does not prescribe a specific \"schema\" to the content you are editing. This means that Slate's core has no concept of \"block quotes\" or \"bold formatting\".\nFor the most part, this leads to increased flexbility without many downsides, but there are certain cases where you have to do a bit more work. Pasting is one of those cases.\nSince Slate knows nothing about your domain, it can't know how to parse pasted HTML content (or other content). So, by default whenever a user pastes content into a Slate editor, it will parse it as plain text. If you want it to be smarter about pasted content, you need to override the insert_data command and deserialize the DataTransfer object's text/html data as you wish.\nWhat browsers and devices does Slate support?\nSlate's goal is to support all the modern browsers on both desktop and mobile devices.\nSlate is in beta and is community-driven and so its support is not as robust as it could be.\nOn the desktop, it's currently tested against the latest few versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari on desktops. And it does not work in Internet Explorer.\nOn mobile, iOS devices are supported but not regularly tested. Chrome on Android was until recently unsupported except for in older versions of Slate (0.47) but has recently been added. For clarity, due to the differences in Android's support of the beforeInput event, Android input uses compositions and mutations which is different from other browsers. This means that Android support progresses separately from other browsers and due to it being new, may have more bugs.\nIf you want to add or improve browser or device support, we'd love for you to submit a pull request! Or in the case of incompatible browsers, build a plugin.\nFor older browsers, such as IE11, a lot of the now standard native APIs aren't available. Slate's position on this is that it is up to the user to bring polyfills (like https://polyfill.io) when needed for things like el.closest, etc. Otherwise we'd have to bundle and maintain lots of polyfills that others may not even need in the first place. For clarity, Slate makes no guarantees that it will work with older browsers, even with polyfills and at present, there are still unresolved issues with IE11.\n"}}}
